I got to photograph a legend this month for FourFourTwo Magazine;UnionFeatures;2025-11-28;https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/1p8r1hy/i_got_to_photograph_a_legend_this_month_for/;"https://preview.redd.it/n9ypx2evyy3g1.jpg?width=875&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c63e344383ef33ff384cc9301262b16fa1524dd6  I was lucky enough to shoot Paul ""Gazza"" Gascoigne for this month's FourFourTwo Magazine.  For me, Gazza is one of the most talented players to ever pull on an England shirt, so to spend a few hours in the studio with him was a real privilege. Paul is battling his demons with a decades-long struggle with alcohol addiction, but he's still a laugh-a-minute joke machine who obviously takes great joy from putting a smile on people's faces.  His goal in Euro '96 will live with me forever."
What caused the football world to use 442 in the 90s;Admirable_Drawer_205;2025-11-28;https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/1p8v6u2/what_caused_the_football_world_to_use_442_in_the/;Looking back at the 70s/80s, lots of teams used 3 man midfields or 3 man attacks or build up with 3 centerbacks just like today. Tactical innovation caused teams to use 433 in the 2000s and today to attack with 5 players up top to break down 4 man defences  Theres logic everywhere to every tactical progression per decade. But what the hell caused teams in the 90s to use 442?

Ex-Ajax director Marc Overmars sent pornographic Whatsapp messages to female employees at Ajax, while jerking off at the same time. Overmars had the power to decide whether female employees were allowed to keep working at Ajax, which made them feel forced to respond to his messages on Whatsapp;DavidRolands;2025-11-22;https://www.parool.nl/sport/nieuw-boek-het-ajax-dna-onthult-grensoverschrijdend-gedrag-marc-overmars-bij-ajax-was-geen-incident~baabacd1/?referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fold.reddit.com%2F;A book has been released which gives more insight to the terrible behavior of Marc Overmars during his time as Technical Director at Ajax.      For example, Marc Overmars would send pornographic-themed Whatsapp messages to female employees at Ajax, while jerking off at the same time.      Meanwhile it was Marc Overmars himself who had the power to decide whether these same female employees were allowed to keep working at Ajax, which made them feel forced to respond to his messages on Whatsapp.      Overmars would masturbate on the toilets at Ajax while sending messages to female employees working at the club. Some of the female employees who received pictures noticed red and white tiles on the walls of the toilet, which then made them realize he was doing it on the toilets within the club.      Ajax were shocked when they found out, and sacked him with immediate effect.

Could new blood tests detect hidden heart damage in footballers before collapse?;MikioSexo;2025-11-21;https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/1p34np7/could_new_blood_tests_detect_hidden_heart_damage/;   So I just went down a rabbit hole on Christian Eriksen's collapse and found something wild.  Turns out there are studies from Stanford, German sports cardiology groups, and European elite athlete programs showing that before athletes have cardiac events, their blood shows elevated cardiac-specific cfDNA. Basically their heart cells are releasing detectable DNA when they're under serious stress - before any symptoms show up.  They've seen this in marathoners, cyclists, soccer players, triathletes. The spike happens when the myocardium is getting damaged but the athlete still feels fine.  If this actually works reliably, we could screen for this and potentially predict who's at risk before they collapse on the field. Right now we're just doing ECGs and echos and hoping we catch something.  I made a quick video breaking down how the testing works because I think this is genuinely exciting for the future of sports cardiology.  📹 [https://youtube.com/shorts/qu43b-FhrdI?feature=share](https://youtube.com/shorts/qu43b-FhrdI?feature=share)  Has anyone here seen this being used in practice yet? Or heard about it being implemented anywhere?

Validation and Comparison of Instrumented Mouthguards for Measuring Head Kinematics and Assessing Brain Deformation in Football Impacts;Yuzhe Liu, August G. Domel, Seyed Abdolmajid Yousefsani, Jovana Kondic, Gerald Grant, Michael Zeineh, David B. Camarillo;2020-08-05;http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01903v2;Because of the relatively rigid coupling between the upper dentition and the skull, instrumented mouthguards have been shown to be a viable way of measuring head impact kinematics for assisting in understanding the underlying biomechanics of concussions. This has led various companies and institutions to further develop instrumented mouthguards. However, their use as a research tool for understanding concussive impacts makes quantification of their accuracy critical, especially given the conflicting results from various recent studies. Here we present a study that uses a pneumatic impactor to deliver impacts characteristic to football to a Hybrid III headform, in order to validate and compare five of the most commonly used instrumented mouthguards. We found that all tested mouthguards gave accurate measurements for the peak angular acceleration (mean relative error, MRE < 13%), the peak angular velocity (MRE < 8%), brain injury criteria values (MRE < 13%) and brain deformation (described as maximum principal strain and fiber strain, calculated by a convolutional neural network based brain model, MRE < 9%). Finally, we found that the accuracy of the measurement varies with the impact locations yet is not sensitive to the impact velocity for the most part.
The classification of football patterns;V. Braungart, D. Kotschick;2006-06-08;http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0606193v1;We prove that every spherical football (also known as a spherical soccer ball) is a branched cover, branched only in the vertices, of the standard football made up of 12 pentagons and 20 hexagons. We also give examples showing that the corresponding result is not true for footballs of higher genera. Moreover, we classify the possible pairs (k,l) for which football patterns on the sphere exist satisfying a natural generalisation of the usual incidence relation between pentagons and hexagons to k-gons and l-gons.
On the flight of an American Football;Curtis Horn, Heidi Fearn;2007-06-04;http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.0366v1;In this paper we examine the detailed theory of the American football in flight, with spin and air resistance included. We find the theory has much in common with the theory of a gyroscope and also rocket trajectory with a misaligned thruster. Unfortunately most of the air resistance data, for rocketry and ballistics, is for speeds of Mach 1 or higher, where the air resistance increases dramatically. We shall approximate a realistic air resistance, at the slower speeds of football flight, with a drag force proportional to cross sectional area and either $v$ or $v^2$, depending on speed, where $v$ is velocity of the football. We begin with a discussion of the motion, giving as much detail as possible without the use of complex analytic calculations. We point out the previous errors made with moments of inertia and make the necessary corrections for more accurate results. We show that the shape of an American football closely resembles a parabola of revolution.
Predictive modelling of football injuries;Stylianos Kampakis;2016-09-20;http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07480v1;The goal of this thesis is to investigate the potential of predictive modelling for football injuries. This work was conducted in close collaboration with Tottenham Hotspurs FC (THFC), the PGA European tour and the participation of Wolverhampton Wanderers (WW).   Three investigations were conducted:   1. Predicting the recovery time of football injuries using the UEFA injury recordings: The UEFA recordings is a common standard for recording injuries in professional football. For this investigation, three datasets of UEFA injury recordings were available. Different machine learning algorithms were used in order to build a predictive model. The performance of the machine learning models is then improved by using feature selection conducted through correlation-based subset feature selection and random forests.   2. Predicting injuries in professional football using exposure records: The relationship between exposure (in training hours and match hours) in professional football athletes and injury incidence was studied. A common problem in football is understanding how the training schedule of an athlete can affect the chance of him getting injured. The task was to predict the number of days a player can train before he gets injured.   3. Predicting intrinsic injury incidence using in-training GPS measurements: A significant percentage of football injuries can be attributed to overtraining and fatigue. GPS data collected during training sessions might provide indicators of fatigue, or might be used to detect very intense training sessions which can lead to overtraining. This research used GPS data gathered during training sessions of the first team of THFC, in order to predict whether an injury would take place during a week.
Network analysis of the worldwide footballer transfer market;Ming-Xia Li, Wei-Xing Zhou, H. Eugene Stanley;2018-11-01;http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00300v1;The transfer of football players is an important part in football games. Most studies on the transfer of football players focus on the transfer system and transfer fees but not on the transfer behavior itself. Based on the 470,792 transfer records from 1990 to 2016 among 23,605 football clubs in 206 countries and regions, we construct a directed footballer transfer network (FTN), where the nodes are the football clubs and the links correspond to the footballer transfers. A systemic analysis is conduced on the topological properties of the FTN. We find that the in-degrees, out-degrees, in-strengths and out-strengths of nodes follow bimodal distributions (a power law with exponential decay), while the distribution of link weights has a power-law tail. We further figure out the correlations between node degrees, node strengths and link weights. We also investigate the general characteristics of different measures of network centrality. Our network analysis of the global footballer transfer market sheds new lights into the investigation of the characteristics of transfer activities.
Explaining the difference between men's and women's football;Luca Pappalardo, Alessio Rossi, Giuseppe Pontillo, Michela Natilli, Paolo Cintia;2021-01-05;http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.01662v1;Women's football is gaining supporters and practitioners worldwide, raising questions about what the differences are with men's football. While the two sports are often compared based on the players' physical attributes, we analyze the spatio-temporal events during matches in the last World Cups to compare male and female teams based on their technical performance. We train an artificial intelligence model to recognize if a team is male or female based on variables that describe a match's playing intensity, accuracy, and performance quality. Our model accurately distinguishes between men's and women's football, revealing crucial technical differences, which we investigate through the extraction of explanations from the classifier's decisions. The differences between men's and women's football are rooted in play accuracy, the recovery time of ball possession, and the players' performance quality. Our methodology may help journalists and fans understand what makes women's football a distinct sport and coaches design tactics tailored to female teams.
Fantasy Football Prediction;Roman Lutz;2015-05-26;http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.06918v1;The ubiquity of professional sports and specifically the NFL have lead to an increase in popularity for Fantasy Football. Users have many tools at their disposal: statistics, predictions, rankings of experts and even recommendations of peers. There are issues with all of these, though. Especially since many people pay money to play, the prediction tools should be enhanced as they provide unbiased and easy-to-use assistance for users. This paper provides and discusses approaches to predict Fantasy Football scores of Quarterbacks with relatively limited data. In addition to that, it includes several suggestions on how the data could be enhanced to achieve better results. The dataset consists only of game data from the last six NFL seasons. I used two different methods to predict the Fantasy Football scores of NFL players: Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Neural Networks. The results of both are promising given the limited data that was used.
Machine Learning Modeling to Evaluate the Value of Football Players;Chenyao Li, Stylianos Kampakis, Philip Treleaven;2022-07-22;http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11361v1;In most sports, especially football, most coaches and analysts search for key performance indicators using notational analysis. This method utilizes a statistical summary of events based on video footage and numerical records of goal scores. Unfortunately, this approach is now obsolete owing to the continuous evolutionary increase in technology that simplifies the analysis of more complex process variables through machine learning (ML). Machine learning, a form of artificial intelligence (AI), uses algorithms to detect meaningful patterns and define a structure based on positional data. This research investigates a new method to evaluate the value of current football players, based on establishing the machine learning models to investigate the relations among the various features of players, the salary of players, and the market value of players. The data of the football players used for this project is from several football websites. The data on the salary of football players will be the proxy for evaluating the value of players, and other features will be used to establish and train the ML model for predicting the suitable salary for the players. The motivation is to explore what are the relations between different features of football players and their salaries - how each feature affects their salaries, or which are the most important features to affect the salary? Although many standards can reflect the value of football players, the salary of the players is one of the most intuitive and crucial indexes, so this study will use the salary of players as the proxy to evaluate their value. Moreover, many features of players can affect the valuation of the football players, but the value of players is mainly decided by three types of factors: basic characteristics, performance on the court, and achievements at the club.
Stochastic model for football's collective dynamics;A. Chacoma, N. Almeira, J. I. Perotti, O. V. Billoni;2021-04-20;http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10272v2;In this paper, we study collective interaction dynamics emerging in the game of football-soccer. To do so, we surveyed a database containing body-sensors traces measured during three professional football matches, where we observed statistical patterns that we used to propose a stochastic model for the players' motion in the field. The model, which is based on linear interactions, captures in good approximation the spatiotemporal dynamics of a football team. Our theoretical framework, therefore, becomes an effective analytical tool to uncover the underlying cooperative mechanisms behind the complexity of football plays. Moreover, we showed that it can provide handy theoretical support for coaches to evaluate teams' and players' performances in both training sessions and competitive scenarios.
Networks of international football: communities, evolution and globalization of the game;Yang Li, Gonzalo Mateos;2022-05-21;http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10599v1;As the most popular sport around the globe, the game of football has recently intrigued much research interest to explore and distill useful and appealing information from the sport. Network science and graph-centric methods have been previously applied to study the importance of football players and teams. In this paper, for the first time we study the macroscopic evolution of the football society from a complex network point of view. Football game records within a time window of over a century were collected and expressed in a graph format, where participant teams are represented by graph nodes and the games between them are the graph edges. We carry out community detection and temporal analysis to reveal the dynamic features and the community structures embedded within the football network, offering the evidence of a continuously expanding football society. Spatio-temporal analysis is also implemented to unveil the temporal states that represent distinct development stages in the football history. Our analysis suggests that the evolution of the game receives considerable impact not only from major sport events, but also from multiple social and political incidents. The game of football and its evolution reflect significant historical transitions and turning points, and can provide a novel perspective for the study of the worldwide globalization process.
Seasonal Linear Predictivity in National Football Championships;Giuseppe Jurman;2015-11-19;http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06262v1;Predicting the results of sport matches and competitions is an arising research field, benefiting from the growing amount of available data and the novel data analytics techniques. Excellent forecasts can be achieved by advanced machine learning methods applied to detailed historical data, especially in very popular sports such as football (soccer). Here we show that, despite the large number of confounding factors, the results of a football team in longer competitions (e.g., a national league) follow a basically linear trend useful for predictive purposes, too. In support of this claim, we present a set of experiments of linear regression on a database collecting the yearly results of 707 teams playing in 22 divisions from 11 countries, in 20 football seasons.
Statistics of football dynamics;R. S. Mendes, L. C. Malacarne, C. Anteneodo;2007-06-12;http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.1758v1;We investigate the dynamics of football matches. Our goal is to characterize statistically the temporal sequence of ball movements in this collective sport game, searching for traits of complex behavior. Data were collected over a variety of matches in South American, European and World championships throughout 2005 and 2006. We show that the statistics of ball touches presents power-law tails and can be described by $q$-gamma distributions. To explain such behavior we propose a model that provides information on the characteristics of football dynamics. Furthermore, we discuss the statistics of duration of out-of-play intervals, not directly related to the previous scenario.
How does AI play football? An analysis of RL and real-world football strategies;Atom Scott, Keisuke Fujii, Masaki Onishi;2021-11-24;http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.12340v1;Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have made it possible to develop sophisticated agents that excel in a wide range of applications. Simulations using such agents can provide valuable information in scenarios that are difficult to scientifically experiment in the real world. In this paper, we examine the play-style characteristics of football RL agents and uncover how strategies may develop during training. The learnt strategies are then compared with those of real football players. We explore what can be learnt from the use of simulated environments by using aggregated statistics and social network analysis (SNA). As a result, we found that (1) there are strong correlations between the competitiveness of an agent and various SNA metrics and (2) aspects of the RL agents play style become similar to real world footballers as the agent becomes more competitive. We discuss further advances that may be necessary to improve our understanding necessary to fully utilise RL for the analysis of football.
A mathematical take on the competitive balance of a football league;Soudeep Deb;2021-02-18;http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.09288v1;Competitive balance in a football league is extremely important from the perspective of economic growth of the industry. Many researchers have earlier proposed different measures of competitive balance, which are primarily adapted from the standard economic theory. However, these measures fail to capture the finer nuances of the game. In this work, we discuss a new framework which is more suitable for a football league. First, we present a mathematical proof of an ideal situation where a football league becomes perfectly balanced. Next, a goal based index for competitive balance is developed. We present relevant theoretical results and show how the proposed index can be used to formally test for the presence of imbalance. The methods are implemented on the data from top five European leagues, and it shows that the new approach can better explain the changes in the seasonal competitive balance of the leagues. Further, using appropriate panel data models, we show that the proposed index is more suitable to analyze the variability in total revenues of the football leagues.
Pricing Football Players using Neural Networks;Sourya Dey;2017-11-16;http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05865v2;We designed a multilayer perceptron neural network to predict the price of a football (soccer) player using data on more than 15,000 players from the football simulation video game FIFA 2017. The network was optimized by experimenting with different activation functions, number of neurons and layers, learning rate and its decay, Nesterov momentum based stochastic gradient descent, L2 regularization, and early stopping. Simultaneous exploration of various aspects of neural network training is performed and their trade-offs are investigated. Our final model achieves a top-5 accuracy of 87.2% among 119 pricing categories, and places any footballer within 6.32% of his actual price on average.
A comprehensive survey of the home advantage in American football;Luke S. Benz, Thompson J. Bliss, Michael J. Lopez;2024-01-29;http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16392v3;The existence and justification to the home advantage -- the benefit a sports team receives when playing at home -- has been studied across sport. The majority of research on this topic is limited to individual leagues in short time frames, which hinders extrapolation and a deeper understanding of possible causes. Using nearly two decades of data from the National Football League (NFL), the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), and high schools from across the United States, we provide a uniform approach to understanding the home advantage in American football. Our findings suggest home advantage is declining in the NFL and the highest levels of collegiate football, but not in amateur football. This increases the possibility that characteristics of the NCAA and NFL, such as travel improvements and instant replay, have helped level the playing field.
The football model, stochastic ordering and martingale transport;Gaoyue Guo, Nicolas Juillet, Wenpin Tang;2025-03-10;http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07145v2;Tournaments are competitions between a number of teams, the outcome of which determines the relative strength or rank of each team. In many cases, the strength of a team in the tournament is given by a score. Perhaps, the most striking mathematical result on the tournament is Moon's theorem, which provides a necessary and sufficient condition for a feasible score sequence via majorization. To give a probabilistic interpretation of Moon's result, Aldous and Kolesnik introduced the football model, the existence of which gives a short proof of Moon's theorem. However, the existence proof of Aldous and Kolesnik is nonconstructive, leading to the question of a ``canonical'' construction of the football model. The purpose of this paper is to provide explicit constructions of the football model with an additional stochastic ordering constraint, which can be formulated by martingale transport. Two solutions are given: one is by solving an entropy optimization problem via Sinkhorn's algorithm, and the other relies on the idea of shadow couplings. It turns out that both constructions yield the property of strong stochastic transitivity. The nontransitive situations of the football model are also considered.
Deciding football sequences;A. Iványi, J. E. Schoenfield;2012-07-26;http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.6384v1;An open problem posed by the first author is the complexity to decide whether a sequence of nonnegative integer numbers can be the final score of a football tournament. In this paper we propose polynomial time approximate and exponential time exact algorithms which solve the problem.
Using Twitter to predict football outcomes;Stylianos Kampakis, Andreas Adamides;2014-11-05;http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1243v1;Twitter has been proven to be a notable source for predictive modelling on various domains such as the stock market, the dissemination of diseases or sports outcomes. However, such a study has not been conducted in football (soccer) so far. The purpose of this research was to study whether data mined from Twitter can be used for this purpose. We built a set of predictive models for the outcome of football games of the English Premier League for a 3 month period based on tweets and we studied whether these models can overcome predictive models which use only historical data and simple football statistics. Moreover, combined models are constructed using both Twitter and historical data. The final results indicate that data mined from Twitter can indeed be a useful source for predicting games in the Premier League. The final Twitter-based model performs significantly better than chance when measured by Cohen's kappa and is comparable to the model that uses simple statistics and historical data. Combining both models raises the performance higher than it was achieved by each individual model. Thereby, this study provides evidence that Twitter derived features can indeed provide useful information for the prediction of football (soccer) outcomes.
Predicting football tables by a maximally parsimonious model;Kjetil Haugen, Brynjulf Owren;2018-05-23;http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08937v1;This paper presents some useful mathematical results involved in football table prediction. In addition, some empirical results indicate that an alternative methodology for football table prediction may produce high quality forecasts with far less resource usage than conventional methods.
FootApp: an AI-Powered System for Football Match Annotation;Silvio Barra, Salvatore M. Carta, Alessandro Giuliani, Alessia Pisu, Alessandro Sebastian Podda, DanieleRiboni;2021-03-04;http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.02938v1;In the last years, scientific and industrial research has experienced a growing interest in acquiring large annotated data sets to train artificial intelligence algorithms for tackling problems in different domains. In this context, we have observed that even the market for football data has substantially grown. The analysis of football matches relies on the annotation of both individual players' and team actions, as well as the athletic performance of players. Consequently, annotating football events at a fine-grained level is a very expensive and error-prone task. Most existing semi-automatic tools for football match annotation rely on cameras and computer vision. However, those tools fall short in capturing team dynamics, and in extracting data of players who are not visible in the camera frame. To address these issues, in this manuscript we present FootApp, an AI-based system for football match annotation. First, our system relies on an advanced and mixed user interface that exploits both vocal and touch interaction. Second, the motor performance of players is captured and processed by applying machine learning algorithms to data collected from inertial sensors worn by players. Artificial intelligence techniques are then used to check the consistency of generated labels, including those regarding the physical activity of players, to automatically recognize annotation errors. Notably, we implemented a full prototype of the proposed system, performing experiments to show its effectiveness in a real-world adoption scenario.
PhysicsFC: Learning User-Controlled Skills for a Physics-Based Football Player Controller;Minsu Kim, Eunho Jung, Yoonsang Lee;2025-04-29;http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21216v2;We propose PhysicsFC, a method for controlling physically simulated football player characters to perform a variety of football skills--such as dribbling, trapping, moving, and kicking--based on user input, while seamlessly transitioning between these skills. Our skill-specific policies, which generate latent variables for each football skill, are trained using an existing physics-based motion embedding model that serves as a foundation for reproducing football motions. Key features include a tailored reward design for the Dribble policy, a two-phase reward structure combined with projectile dynamics-based initialization for the Trap policy, and a Data-Embedded Goal-Conditioned Latent Guidance (DEGCL) method for the Move policy. Using the trained skill policies, the proposed football player finite state machine (PhysicsFC FSM) allows users to interactively control the character. To ensure smooth and agile transitions between skill policies, as defined in the FSM, we introduce the Skill Transition-Based Initialization (STI), which is applied during the training of each skill policy. We develop several interactive scenarios to showcase PhysicsFC's effectiveness, including competitive trapping and dribbling, give-and-go plays, and 11v11 football games, where multiple PhysicsFC agents produce natural and controllable physics-based football player behaviors. Quantitative evaluations further validate the performance of individual skill policies and the transitions between them, using the presented metrics and experimental designs.
Automated Explanation of Machine Learning Models of Footballing Actions in Words;Pegah Rahimian, Jernej Flisar, David Sumpter;2025-04-01;http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00767v1;While football analytics has changed the way teams and analysts assess performance, there remains a communication gap between machine learning practice and how coaching staff talk about football. Coaches and practitioners require actionable insights, which are not always provided by models. To bridge this gap, we show how to build wordalizations (a novel approach that leverages large language models) for shots in football. Specifically, we first build an expected goals model using logistic regression. We then use the co-efficients of this regression model to write sentences describing how factors (such as distance, angle and defensive pressure) contribute to the model's prediction. Finally, we use large language models to give an entertaining description of the shot. We describe our approach in a model card and provide an interactive open-source application describing shots in recent tournaments. We discuss how shot wordalisations might aid communication in coaching and football commentary, and give a further example of how the same approach can be applied to other actions in football.
nflWAR: A Reproducible Method for Offensive Player Evaluation in Football;Ronald Yurko, Samuel Ventura, Maksim Horowitz;2018-02-03;http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00998v2;Unlike other major professional sports, American football lacks comprehensive statistical ratings for player evaluation that are both reproducible and easily interpretable in terms of game outcomes. Existing methods for player evaluation in football depend heavily on proprietary data, are not reproducible, and lag behind those of other major sports. We present four contributions to the study of football statistics in order to address these issues. First, we develop the R package nflscrapR to provide easy access to publicly available play-by-play data from the National Football League (NFL) dating back to 2009. Second, we introduce a novel multinomial logistic regression approach for estimating the expected points for each play. Third, we use the expected points as input into a generalized additive model for estimating the win probability for each play. Fourth, we introduce our nflWAR framework, using multilevel models to isolate the contributions of individual offensive skill players, and providing estimates for their individual wins above replacement (WAR). We estimate the uncertainty in each player's WAR through a resampling approach specifically designed for football, and we present these results for the 2017 NFL season. We discuss how our reproducible WAR framework, built entirely on publicly available data, can be easily extended to estimate WAR for players at any position, provided that researchers have access to data specifying which players are on the field during each play. Finally, we discuss the potential implications of this work for NFL teams.
Google Research Football: A Novel Reinforcement Learning Environment;Karol Kurach, Anton Raichuk, Piotr Stańczyk, Michał Zając, Olivier Bachem, Lasse Espeholt, Carlos Riquelme, Damien Vincent, Marcin Michalski, Olivier Bousquet, Sylvain Gelly;2019-07-25;http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11180v2;Recent progress in the field of reinforcement learning has been accelerated by virtual learning environments such as video games, where novel algorithms and ideas can be quickly tested in a safe and reproducible manner. We introduce the Google Research Football Environment, a new reinforcement learning environment where agents are trained to play football in an advanced, physics-based 3D simulator. The resulting environment is challenging, easy to use and customize, and it is available under a permissive open-source license. In addition, it provides support for multiplayer and multi-agent experiments. We propose three full-game scenarios of varying difficulty with the Football Benchmarks and report baseline results for three commonly used reinforcement algorithms (IMPALA, PPO, and Ape-X DQN). We also provide a diverse set of simpler scenarios with the Football Academy and showcase several promising research directions.
Identifying top football players and springboard clubs from a football player collaboration and club transfer networks;Matic Tribušon, Matevž Lenič;2016-02-11;http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.03664v1;We consider all players and clubs in top twenty world football leagues in the last fifteen seasons. The purpose of this paper is to reveal top football players and identify springboard clubs. To do that, we construct two separate weighted networks. Player collaboration network consists of players, that are connected to each other if they ever played together at the same club. In directed club transfer network, clubs are connected if players were ever transferred from one club to another. To get meaningful results, we perform different network analysis methods on our networks. Our approach based on PageRank reveals Christiano Ronaldo as the top player. Using a variation of betweenness centrality, we identify Standard Liege as the best springboard club.
Comparing probabilistic predictive models applied to football;Marcio A. Diniz, Rafael Izbicki, Danilo Lopes, Luis Ernesto Salasar;2017-05-11;http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.04356v1;We propose two Bayesian multinomial-Dirichlet models to predict the final outcome of football (soccer) matches and compare them to three well-known models regarding their predictive power. All the models predicted the full-time results of 1710 matches of the first division of the Brazilian football championship and the comparison used three proper scoring rules, the proportion of errors and a calibration assessment. We also provide a goodness of fit measure. Our results show that multinomial-Dirichlet models are not only competitive with standard approaches, but they are also well calibrated and present reasonable goodness of fit.
Automatic event detection in football using tracking data;Ferran Vidal-Codina, Nicolas Evans, Bahaeddine El Fakir, Johsan Billingham;2022-02-01;http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.00804v3;"One of the main shortcomings of event data in football, which has been extensively used for analytics in the recent years, is that it still requires manual collection, thus limiting its availability to a reduced number of tournaments. In this work, we propose a deterministic decision tree-based algorithm to automatically extract football events using tracking data, which consists of two steps: (1) a possession step that evaluates which player was in possession of the ball at each frame in the tracking data, as well as the distinct player configurations during the time intervals where the ball is not in play to inform set piece detection; (2) an event detection step that combines the changes in ball possession computed in the first step with the laws of football to determine in-game events and set pieces. The automatically generated events are benchmarked against manually annotated events and we show that in most event categories the proposed methodology achieves $+90\%$ detection rate across different tournaments and tracking data providers. Finally, we demonstrate how the contextual information offered by tracking data can be leveraged to increase the granularity of auto-detected events, and exhibit how the proposed framework may be used to conduct a myriad of data analyses in football."
Game Plan: What AI can do for Football, and What Football can do for AI;Karl Tuyls, Shayegan Omidshafiei, Paul Muller, Zhe Wang, Jerome Connor, Daniel Hennes, Ian Graham, William Spearman, Tim Waskett, Dafydd Steele, Pauline Luc, Adria Recasens, Alexandre Galashov, Gregory Thornton, Romuald Elie, Pablo Sprechmann, Pol Moreno, Kris Cao, Marta Garnelo, Praneet Dutta, Michal Valko, Nicolas Heess, Alex Bridgland, Julien Perolat, Bart De Vylder, Ali Eslami, Mark Rowland, Andrew Jaegle, Remi Munos, Trevor Back, Razia Ahamed, Simon Bouton, Nathalie Beauguerlange, Jackson Broshear, Thore Graepel, Demis Hassabis;2020-11-18;http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.09192v1;The rapid progress in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning has opened unprecedented analytics possibilities in various team and individual sports, including baseball, basketball, and tennis. More recently, AI techniques have been applied to football, due to a huge increase in data collection by professional teams, increased computational power, and advances in machine learning, with the goal of better addressing new scientific challenges involved in the analysis of both individual players' and coordinated teams' behaviors. The research challenges associated with predictive and prescriptive football analytics require new developments and progress at the intersection of statistical learning, game theory, and computer vision. In this paper, we provide an overarching perspective highlighting how the combination of these fields, in particular, forms a unique microcosm for AI research, while offering mutual benefits for professional teams, spectators, and broadcasters in the years to come. We illustrate that this duality makes football analytics a game changer of tremendous value, in terms of not only changing the game of football itself, but also in terms of what this domain can mean for the field of AI. We review the state-of-the-art and exemplify the types of analysis enabled by combining the aforementioned fields, including illustrative examples of counterfactual analysis using predictive models, and the combination of game-theoretic analysis of penalty kicks with statistical learning of player attributes. We conclude by highlighting envisioned downstream impacts, including possibilities for extensions to other sports (real and virtual).
Moving from Machine Learning to Statistics: the case of Expected Points in American football;Ryan S. Brill, Ryan Yee, Sameer K. Deshpande, Abraham J. Wyner;2024-09-07;http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04889v1;"Expected points is a value function fundamental to player evaluation and strategic in-game decision-making across sports analytics, particularly in American football. To estimate expected points, football analysts use machine learning tools, which are not equipped to handle certain challenges. They suffer from selection bias, display counter-intuitive artifacts of overfitting, do not quantify uncertainty in point estimates, and do not account for the strong dependence structure of observational football data. These issues are not unique to American football or even sports analytics; they are general problems analysts encounter across various statistical applications, particularly when using machine learning in lieu of traditional statistical models. We explore these issues in detail and devise expected points models that account for them. We also introduce a widely applicable novel methodological approach to mitigate overfitting, using a catalytic prior to smooth our machine learning models."
The football player and the infinite series;Harold P. Boas;1997-06-25;http://arxiv.org/abs/math/9705204v1;This is the text of an expository talk given at the May 1997 Detroit meeting of the American Mathematical Society. It is a tale of a famous football player and a subtle problem he posed about the uniform convergence of Dirichlet series. Hiding in the background is the theory of analytic functions of an infinite number of variables.
Football tracking networks: Beyond event-based connectivity;J. M. Buldu, D. Garrido, D. R. Antequera, J. Busquets, E. Estrada, R. Resta, R. Lopez del Campo;2020-11-11;http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.06014v1;We propose using Network Science as a complementary tool to analyze player and team behavior during a football match. Specifically, we introduce four kinds of networks based on different ways of interaction between players. Our approach's main novelty is to use tracking datasets to create football tracking networks, instead of constructing and analyzing the traditional networks based on events. In this way, we are able to capture player interactions that go beyond passes and introduce the concepts of (a) Ball Flow Networks, (b) Marking Networks, (c) Signed Proximity Networks and (d) Functional Coordination Networks. After defining the methodology for creating each kind of network, we show some examples using tracking datasets from four different matches of LaLiga Santander. Finally, we discuss some of the applications, limitations, and further improvements of football tracking networks.
Investigating Sports Commentator Bias within a Large Corpus of American Football Broadcasts;Jack Merullo, Luke Yeh, Abram Handler, Alvin Grissom, Brendan O'Connor, Mohit Iyyer;2019-09-07;http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.03343v4;Sports broadcasters inject drama into play-by-play commentary by building team and player narratives through subjective analyses and anecdotes. Prior studies based on small datasets and manual coding show that such theatrics evince commentator bias in sports broadcasts. To examine this phenomenon, we assemble FOOTBALL, which contains 1,455 broadcast transcripts from American football games across six decades that are automatically annotated with 250K player mentions and linked with racial metadata. We identify major confounding factors for researchers examining racial bias in FOOTBALL, and perform a computational analysis that supports conclusions from prior social science studies.
Effect of Key Match Events on Football Passmaps;Vid Stropnik, Vuk Đuranović, Maruša Oražem;2021-08-11;http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.05343v1;A team of association football players may be envisioned as a directed network with player nodes and weighted pass edges. Such a simplistic representation of an otherwise complex structure yields several benefits, but also permits the application of well-established network analysis approaches, to gain insights into the match flow. The authors of this work propose the application of these, including centrality measures, community detection methods, and the analysis of induced subgraphs, to analyze the potential effects certain match events have on the team. In addition to reporting on their findings, they emphasize their work's contribution of over 9000 novel football network representations to the Network Analysis community.
Pólya urn model for analysis of football passes;Ken Yamamoto;2025-11-06;http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04089v1;This study analyzes pass networks in football (soccer) using a stochastic model known as the Pólya urn. By focusing on preferential selection, it theoretically demonstrates that the time evolution of networks can be characterized by a single parameter. Building on this result, a data analysis method is proposed and applied to a large-scale public dataset of professional football matches. The statistical properties of the preferential-selection parameter are examined, demonstrating its correlation with pass accuracy and with mean pass difficulty. This method is applicable to various evolving networks.
Concussion and head acceleration exposure in elite rugby union and American football: Interpreting indicative trends;Gregory Tierney;2025-02-21;http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15405v3;Elite-level American football and rugby union are two high-contact sports with growing clinical and legal concerns over player safety. A comparison of current indicative trends in concussion and head acceleration events (HAEs) in elite-level American football and rugby union was undertaken. Rugby union players have a greater number of professional playing years and matches available in a season than their American football counterparts. Rugby union players have a greater number of concussions reported per match and a higher proportion of concussions occurring during training sessions, based on National Football League (NFL) and Rugby Football Union (RFU) injury reports. Preliminary findings indicate that rugby union forwards experience a higher incidence of HAEs per player match over lower and higher magnitude thresholds, than American football defensive players. Taken collectively, current evidence indicates a trend toward greater reported exposure in elite-level rugby union across several key metrics. These patterns highlight the need for independent, transparent, and scientifically rigorous research to better understand concussion and HAE biomechanics and to support the development of effective mitigation strategies in contact sport.
Regularities in football goal distributions;L. C. Malacarne, R. S. Mendes;2000-02-07;http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0002100v1;Besides of complexities concerning to football championships, it is identified some regularities in them. These regularities refer to goal distributions by goal-players and by games. In particular, the goal distribution by goal-players it well adjusted by the Zipf-Mandelbrot law, suggesting a conection with an anomalous decay.
Deep Artificial Intelligence for Fantasy Football Language Understanding;Aaron Baughman, Micah Forester, Jeff Powell, Eduardo Morales, Shaun McPartlin, Daniel Bohm;2021-11-04;http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.02874v1;Fantasy sports allow fans to manage a team of their favorite athletes and compete with friends. The fantasy platform aligns the real-world statistical performance of athletes to fantasy scoring and has steadily risen in popularity to an estimated 9.1 million players per month with 4.4 billion player card views on the ESPN Fantasy Football platform from 2018-2019. In parallel, the sports media community produces news stories, blogs, forum posts, tweets, videos, podcasts and opinion pieces that are both within and outside the context of fantasy sports. However, human fantasy football players can only analyze an average of 3.9 sources of information. Our work discusses the results of a machine learning pipeline to manage an ESPN Fantasy Football team. The use of trained statistical entity detectors and document2vector models applied to over 100,000 news sources and 2.3 million articles, videos and podcasts each day enables the system to comprehend natural language with an analogy test accuracy of 100% and keyword test accuracy of 80%. Deep learning feedforward neural networks provide player classifications such as if a player will be a bust, boom, play with a hidden injury or play meaningful touches with a cumulative 72% accuracy. Finally, a multiple regression ensemble uses the deep learning output and ESPN projection data to provide a point projection for each of the top 500+ fantasy football players in 2018. The point projection maintained a RMSE of 6.78 points. The best fit probability density function from a set of 24 is selected to visualize score spreads. Within the first 6 weeks of the product launch, the total number of users spent a cumulative time of over 4.6 years viewing our AI insights. The training data for our models was provided by a 2015 to 2016 web archive from Webhose, ESPN statistics, and Rotowire injury reports. We used 2017 fantasy football data as a test set.
Urban scaling of football followership on Twitter;Eszter Bokanyi, Attila Soti, Gabor Vattay;2018-12-11;http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.04453v1;Social sciences have an important challenge today to take advantage of new research opportunities provided by large amounts of data generated by online social networks. Because of its marketing value, sports clubs are also motivated in creating and maintaining a stable audience in social media. In this paper, we analyze followers of prominent footballs clubs on Twitter by obtaining their home locations. We then measure how city size is connected to the number of followers using the theory of urban scaling. The results show that the scaling exponents of club followers depend on the income of a country. These findings could be used to understand the structure and potential growth areas of global football audiences.
Are penalty shootouts better than a coin toss? Evidence from European football;László Csató, Dóra Gréta Petróczy;2025-10-20;http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17641v2;Penalty shootouts play an important role in the knockout stage of major football tournaments, especially since the 2021/22 season, when the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) scrapped the away goals rule in its club competitions. Inspired by this rule change, our paper examines whether the outcome of a penalty shootout can be predicted in UEFA club competitions. Based on all shootouts between 2000 and 2025, we find no evidence for the effect of the kicking order, the field of the match, or psychological momentum. In contrast to previous results, stronger teams, defined first by Elo ratings, do not perform better than their weaker opponents. Consequently, penalty shootouts are equivalent to a perfect lottery in top European football.
Graph Neural Network based Agent in Google Research Football;Yizhan Niu, Jinglong Liu, Yuhao Shi, Jiren Zhu;2022-04-23;http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11142v1;Deep neural networks (DNN) can approximate value functions or policies for reinforcement learning, which makes the reinforcement learning algorithms more powerful. However, some DNNs, such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), cannot extract enough information or take too long to obtain enough features from the inputs under specific circumstances of reinforcement learning. For example, the input data of Google Research Football, a reinforcement learning environment which trains agents to play football, is the small map of players' locations. The information is contained not only in the coordinates of players, but also in the relationships between different players. CNNs can neither extract enough information nor take too long to train. To address this issue, this paper proposes a deep q-learning network (DQN) with a graph neural network (GNN) as its model. The GNN transforms the input data into a graph which better represents the football players' locations so that it extracts more information of the interactions between different players. With two GNNs to approximate its local and target value functions, this DQN allows players to learn from their experience by using value functions to see the prospective value of each intended action. The proposed model demonstrated the power of GNN in the football game by outperforming other DRL models with significantly fewer steps.
Motif analysis and passing behavior in football passing networks;Ming-Xia Li, Li-Gong Xu, Wei-Xing Zhou;2024-08-15;http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07927v1;The strategic orchestration of football matchplays profoundly influences game outcomes, motivating a surge in research aimed at uncovering tactical nuances through social network analysis. In this paper, we delve into the microscopic intricacies of cooperative player interactions by focusing on triadic motifs within passing networks. Employing a dataset compiled from 3,199 matches across 18 premier football competitions, we identify successful passing activities and construct passing networks for both home and away teams. Our findings highlight a pronounced disparity in passing efficiency, with home teams demonstrating superior performance relative to away teams. Through the identification and analysis of 3-motifs, we find that the motifs with more bidirectional links are more significant. It reveals that footballers exhibit a strong tendency towards backward passes rather than direct forward attacks. Comparing the results of games, we find that some motifs are related to the goal difference. It indicates that direct and effective forward passing significantly amplifies a team's offensive capabilities, whereas an abundance of passbacks portends an elevated risk of offensive futility. These revelations affirm the efficacy of network motif analysis as a potent analytical tool for unveiling the foundational components of passing dynamics among footballers and for decoding the complex tactical behaviors and interaction modalities that underpin team performance.
Suspense and Surprise in European Football;Raphael Flepp, Tim Pawlowski, Travis Richardson;2025-06-26;http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21253v1;We propose utilizing match-level suspense and surprise - which capture the entertainment utility created by competitive balance and outcome uncertainty for sports spectators - as alternative policy targets for league organizers and managers. Through simulations, we derive a benchmark range for suspense and surprise based on a perfectly balanced match before analyzing over 25,000 men's matches (2010/11-2023/24) and 725 women's matches (2023/24) from Europe's top football leagues. Our findings reveal that an average match generates lower suspense compared to the benchmark range, particularly for top teams, while surprise values consistently align with the benchmark. Moreover, we observe nuanced trends over time in men's football and highlight notable differences across leagues and clubs in both men's and women's competitions. These insights enhance our understanding of how the attractiveness of matches arises from competitive balance and carry important policy implications.
TacticAI: an AI assistant for football tactics;Zhe Wang, Petar Veličković, Daniel Hennes, Nenad Tomašev, Laurel Prince, Michael Kaisers, Yoram Bachrach, Romuald Elie, Li Kevin Wenliang, Federico Piccinini, William Spearman, Ian Graham, Jerome Connor, Yi Yang, Adrià Recasens, Mina Khan, Nathalie Beauguerlange, Pablo Sprechmann, Pol Moreno, Nicolas Heess, Michael Bowling, Demis Hassabis, Karl Tuyls;2023-10-16;http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10553v2;Identifying key patterns of tactics implemented by rival teams, and developing effective responses, lies at the heart of modern football. However, doing so algorithmically remains an open research challenge. To address this unmet need, we propose TacticAI, an AI football tactics assistant developed and evaluated in close collaboration with domain experts from Liverpool FC. We focus on analysing corner kicks, as they offer coaches the most direct opportunities for interventions and improvements. TacticAI incorporates both a predictive and a generative component, allowing the coaches to effectively sample and explore alternative player setups for each corner kick routine and to select those with the highest predicted likelihood of success. We validate TacticAI on a number of relevant benchmark tasks: predicting receivers and shot attempts and recommending player position adjustments. The utility of TacticAI is validated by a qualitative study conducted with football domain experts at Liverpool FC. We show that TacticAI's model suggestions are not only indistinguishable from real tactics, but also favoured over existing tactics 90% of the time, and that TacticAI offers an effective corner kick retrieval system. TacticAI achieves these results despite the limited availability of gold-standard data, achieving data efficiency through geometric deep learning.
X-VARS: Introducing Explainability in Football Refereeing with Multi-Modal Large Language Model;Jan Held, Hani Itani, Anthony Cioppa, Silvio Giancola, Bernard Ghanem, Marc Van Droogenbroeck;2024-04-07;http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06332v1;The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence has led to significant improvements in automated decision-making. However, the increased performance of models often comes at the cost of explainability and transparency of their decision-making processes. In this paper, we investigate the capabilities of large language models to explain decisions, using football refereeing as a testing ground, given its decision complexity and subjectivity. We introduce the Explainable Video Assistant Referee System, X-VARS, a multi-modal large language model designed for understanding football videos from the point of view of a referee. X-VARS can perform a multitude of tasks, including video description, question answering, action recognition, and conducting meaningful conversations based on video content and in accordance with the Laws of the Game for football referees. We validate X-VARS on our novel dataset, SoccerNet-XFoul, which consists of more than 22k video-question-answer triplets annotated by over 70 experienced football referees. Our experiments and human study illustrate the impressive capabilities of X-VARS in interpreting complex football clips. Furthermore, we highlight the potential of X-VARS to reach human performance and support football referees in the future.
Optimising Game Tactics for Football;Ryan Beal, Georgios Chalkiadakis, Timothy J. Norman, Sarvapali D. Ramchurn;2020-03-23;http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.10294v1;In this paper we present a novel approach to optimise tactical and strategic decision making in football (soccer). We model the game of football as a multi-stage game which is made up from a Bayesian game to model the pre-match decisions and a stochastic game to model the in-match state transitions and decisions. Using this formulation, we propose a method to predict the probability of game outcomes and the payoffs of team actions. Building upon this, we develop algorithms to optimise team formation and in-game tactics with different objectives. Empirical evaluation of our approach on real-world datasets from 760 matches shows that by using optimised tactics from our Bayesian and stochastic games, we can increase a team chances of winning by up to 16.1\% and 3.4\% respectively.
Modeling ball possession dynamics in the game of football;A. Chacoma, N. Almeira, J. I. Perotti, O. V. Billoni;2020-05-07;http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.04020v2;In this paper, we study interaction dynamics in the game of football-soccer in the context of ball possession intervals. To do so, we analyze a database comprising one season of the five major football leagues of Europe. Using this input, we developed a stochastic model based on three agents: two teammates and one defender. Despite its simplicity, the model is able to capture, in good approximation, the statistical behavior of possession times, pass lengths, and number of passes performed. In the last section, we show that the model's dynamics can be mapped into a Wiener process with drift and an absorbing barrier.
An Empirical Study on Google Research Football Multi-agent Scenarios;Yan Song, He Jiang, Zheng Tian, Haifeng Zhang, Yingping Zhang, Jiangcheng Zhu, Zonghong Dai, Weinan Zhang, Jun Wang;2023-05-16;http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09458v1;Few multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) research on Google Research Football (GRF) focus on the 11v11 multi-agent full-game scenario and to the best of our knowledge, no open benchmark on this scenario has been released to the public. In this work, we fill the gap by providing a population-based MARL training pipeline and hyperparameter settings on multi-agent football scenario that outperforms the bot with difficulty 1.0 from scratch within 2 million steps. Our experiments serve as a reference for the expected performance of Independent Proximal Policy Optimization (IPPO), a state-of-the-art multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm where each agent tries to maximize its own policy independently across various training configurations. Meanwhile, we open-source our training framework Light-MALib which extends the MALib codebase by distributed and asynchronized implementation with additional analytical tools for football games. Finally, we provide guidance for building strong football AI with population-based training and release diverse pretrained policies for benchmarking. The goal is to provide the community with a head start for whoever experiment their works on GRF and a simple-to-use population-based training framework for further improving their agents through self-play. The implementation is available at https://github.com/Shanghai-Digital-Brain-Laboratory/DB-Football.
Explainable expected goal models for performance analysis in football analytics;Mustafa Cavus, Przemysław Biecek;2022-06-14;http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07212v2;The expected goal provides a more representative measure of the team and player performance which also suit the low-scoring nature of football instead of score in modern football. The score of a match involves randomness and often may not represent the performance of the teams and players, therefore it has been popular to use the alternative statistics in recent years such as shots on target, ball possessions, and drills. To measure the probability of a shot being a goal by the expected goal, several features are used to train an expected goal model which is based on the event and tracking football data. The selection of these features, the size and date of the data, and the model which are used as the parameters that may affect the performance of the model. Using black-box machine learning models for increasing the predictive performance of the model decreases its interpretability that causes the loss of information that can be gathered from the model. This paper proposes an accurate expected goal model trained consisting of 315,430 shots from seven seasons between 2014-15 and 2020-21 of the top-five European football leagues. Moreover, this model is explained by using explainable artificial intelligence tool to obtain an explainable expected goal model for evaluating a team or player performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that demonstrates a practical application of an explainable artificial intelligence tool aggregated profiles to explain a group of observations on an accurate expected goal model for monitoring the team and player performance. Moreover, these methods can be generalized to other sports branches.
Football fever: goal distributions and non-Gaussian statistics;Elmar Bittner, Andreas Nussbaumer, Wolfhard Janke, Martin Weigel;2006-06-01;http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0606016v1;Analyzing football score data with statistical techniques, we investigate how the not purely random, but highly co-operative nature of the game is reflected in averaged properties such as the probability distributions of scored goals for the home and away teams. As it turns out, especially the tails of the distributions are not well described by the Poissonian or binomial model resulting from the assumption of uncorrelated random events. Instead, a good effective description of the data is provided by less basic distributions such as the negative binomial one or the probability densities of extreme value statistics. To understand this behavior from a microscopical point of view, however, no waiting time problem or extremal process need be invoked. Instead, modifying the Bernoulli random process underlying the Poissonian model to include a simple component of self-affirmation seems to describe the data surprisingly well and allows to understand the observed deviation from Gaussian statistics. The phenomenological distributions used before can be understood as special cases within this framework. We analyzed historical football score data from many leagues in Europe as well as from international tournaments, including data from all past tournaments of the ``FIFA World Cup'' series, and found the proposed models to be applicable rather universally. In particular, here we analyse the results of the German women's premier football league and consider the two separate German men's premier leagues in the East and West during the cold war times and the unified league after 1990 to see how scoring in football and the component of self-affirmation depend on cultural and political circumstances.
