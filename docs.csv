"2","reddit","The judge has summoned Barcelona’s vice president, Elena Fort, to testify on January 27.   In addition to the charges against the club, the judicial order has scheduled a round of key testimonies. Former president Joan Gaspart must appear in early February to detail the payments made during his term (2000-2003). The summons also include highly relevant figures for November 25: current president Joan Laporta, for his first term at the helm of the club (2003-2010), and former coaches Luis Enrique and Ernesto Valverde.   Finally, the court has demanded that FC Barcelona deliver, within 20 days, the original contracts signed with the companies Dasnil 95 SL and Nilsad SCP. These documents, which supposedly cover “paid refereeing advisory services” between 2001 and 2014, are crucial to justify the payments. The club had already been asked for this documentation previously, claiming in 2021 that it had no record of formal contracts.   https://onefootball.com/en/news/fc-barcelona-charged-with-corruption-in-the-negreira-case-41868264"

"4","reddit","India has over a billion and a half people, but has never qualified for a Football World Cup.  In 1950 they received a special invitation to the World Cup in Brazil. Can you believe they refused? The reasons seem straight out of another era:  The Indian federation didn't consider football a priority. They were focused on the Olympic Games. The players played barefoot. When they found out they had to wear boots, they said no. The distance between India and Brazil was immense, and the trip cost a fortune.  Football is the most popular sport in the world. It has over 300 million players and about 3.5 billion fans, but the major demographic powers are almost completely absent from the final tournaments.  China, with 1.41 billion inhabitants, has played in the World Cup only once. That was in 2002.  Other huge countries have never participated: Pakistan (255 million), Bangladesh (175 million), Ethiopia (135 million), Philippines (117 million), Vietnam (101 million), Thailand (72 million), Tanzania (71 million), Kenya (58 million), Myanmar (55 million).  If you add them up, you reach almost 3.9 billion people. Half the planet's population. Only China among all of them has been to a World Cup.  On the other hand, tiny countries have achieved what the giants cannot: Iceland, with only 384,000 inhabitants, qualified in 2018. Cape Verde, with less than 500,000 people, will play in 2026. And the best story? Uruguay. 3.5 million inhabitants and two World Cups won."

"11","arxiv","This paper presents some useful mathematical results involved in football table prediction. In addition, some empirical results indicate that an alternative methodology for football table prediction may produce high quality forecasts with far less resource usage than conventional methods."
"12","arxiv","The transfer of football players is an important part in football games. Most studies on the transfer of football players focus on the transfer system and transfer fees but not on the transfer behavior itself. Based on the 470,792 transfer records from 1990 to 2016 among 23,605 football clubs in 206 countries and regions, we construct a directed footballer transfer network (FTN), where the nodes are the football clubs and the links correspond to the footballer transfers. A systemic analysis is conduced on the topological properties of the FTN. We find that the in-degrees, out-degrees, in-strengths and out-strengths of nodes follow bimodal distributions (a power law with exponential decay), while the distribution of link weights has a power-law tail. We further figure out the correlations between node degrees, node strengths and link weights. We also investigate the general characteristics of different measures of network centrality. Our network analysis of the global footballer transfer market sheds new lights into the investigation of the characteristics of transfer activities."
"13","arxiv","As the most popular sport around the globe, the game of football has recently intrigued much research interest to explore and distill useful and appealing information from the sport. Network science and graph-centric methods have been previously applied to study the importance of football players and teams. In this paper, for the first time we study the macroscopic evolution of the football society from a complex network point of view. Football game records within a time window of over a century were collected and expressed in a graph format, where participant teams are represented by graph nodes and the games between them are the graph edges. We carry out community detection and temporal analysis to reveal the dynamic features and the community structures embedded within the football network, offering the evidence of a continuously expanding football society. Spatio-temporal analysis is also implemented to unveil the temporal states that represent distinct development stages in the football history. Our analysis suggests that the evolution of the game receives considerable impact not only from major sport events, but also from multiple social and political incidents. The game of football and its evolution reflect significant historical transitions and turning points, and can provide a novel perspective for the study of the worldwide globalization process."
"14","arxiv","We prove that every spherical football (also known as a spherical soccer ball) is a branched cover, branched only in the vertices, of the standard football made up of 12 pentagons and 20 hexagons. We also give examples showing that the corresponding result is not true for footballs of higher genera. Moreover, we classify the possible pairs (k,l) for which football patterns on the sphere exist satisfying a natural generalisation of the usual incidence relation between pentagons and hexagons to k-gons and l-gons."
"15","arxiv","The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence has led to significant improvements in automated decision-making. However, the increased performance of models often comes at the cost of explainability and transparency of their decision-making processes. In this paper, we investigate the capabilities of large language models to explain decisions, using football refereeing as a testing ground, given its decision complexity and subjectivity. We introduce the Explainable Video Assistant Referee System, X-VARS, a multi-modal large language model designed for understanding football videos from the point of view of a referee. X-VARS can perform a multitude of tasks, including video description, question answering, action recognition, and conducting meaningful conversations based on video content and in accordance with the Laws of the Game for football referees. We validate X-VARS on our novel dataset, SoccerNet-XFoul, which consists of more than 22k video-question-answer triplets annotated by over 70 experienced football referees. Our experiments and human study illustrate the impressive capabilities of X-VARS in interpreting complex football clips. Furthermore, we highlight the potential of X-VARS to reach human performance and support football referees in the future."
"16","arxiv","Elite-level American football and rugby union are two high-contact sports with growing clinical and legal concerns over player safety. A comparison of current indicative trends in concussion and head acceleration events (HAEs) in elite-level American football and rugby union was undertaken. Rugby union players have a greater number of professional playing years and matches available in a season than their American football counterparts. Rugby union players have a greater number of concussions reported per match and a higher proportion of concussions occurring during training sessions, based on National Football League (NFL) and Rugby Football Union (RFU) injury reports. Preliminary findings indicate that rugby union forwards experience a higher incidence of HAEs per player match over lower and higher magnitude thresholds, than American football defensive players. Taken collectively, current evidence indicates a trend toward greater reported exposure in elite-level rugby union across several key metrics. These patterns highlight the need for independent, transparent, and scientifically rigorous research to better understand concussion and HAE biomechanics and to support the development of effective mitigation strategies in contact sport."
"17","arxiv","American football is unique in that offensive and defensive units typically consist of separate players who don't share the field simultaneously, which tempts one to evaluate them independently. However, a team's offensive and defensive performances often complement each other. For instance, turnovers forced by the defense can create easier scoring opportunities for the offense. Using drive-by-drive data from 2014-2020 Division-I college football (Football Bowl Subdivision, FBS) and 2009-2017 National Football League (NFL) seasons, we identify complementary football features that impact scoring the most. We employ regularized ordinal regression with an elastic penalty, enabling variable selection and partially relaxing the proportional odds assumption. Moreover, given the importance of accounting for strength of the opposition, we incorporate unpenalized components to ensure full adjustment for strength of schedule. For residual diagnostics of our ordinal regression models we apply the surrogate approach, creatively extending its use to non-proportional odds models. We then adjust each team's offensive (defensive) performance to project it onto a league-average complementary unit, showcasing the effects of these adjustments on team scoring. Lastly, we evaluate the out-of-sample prediction performance of our selected model, highlighting improvements gained from incorporating complementary football features alongside strength-of-schedule adjustments."

"19","arxiv","Compact Ricci solitons on surfaces have at most two cone points, and are known as Hamilton's footballs. In this note we completely describe the degenerations of these footballs as one or both of the cone angles approaches zero.

"20","arxiv","Datascouting is one of the most known data applications in professional sport, and specifically football. Its objective is to analyze huge database of players in order to detect high potentials that can be then individually considered by human scouts. In this paper, we propose a stacking-based deep learning model to detect high potential football players. Applied on open-source database, our model obtains significantly better results that classical statistical methods."
