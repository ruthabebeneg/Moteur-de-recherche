      "So you can do more than just get by, you can get ahead and stay ahead, because when families are strong, America is strong\n",
      "So I'm hitting the road to earn your vote, because it's your time and I hope you'll join me on this journey\n",
      "I just had a terrific tour of the advanced manufacturing laboratory\n",
      "This is a real model for how we can provide more continuous learning starting in high school but going as far as necessary to help better prepare not only young people but all people for the economy that is awaiting us\n",
      "And before we get started — because I want to hear from each of you, I want more information about what you see as challenges as students and educators and the opportunities you hope to take advantage of — I just want to tell you a little bit about why I'm here today\n",
      "And our economy and our country are much better off because American families have basically done whatever it took to make it work\n",
      "There's something wrong when American workers keep getting more productive, as they have, and as I just saw a few minutes ago, is very possibly possible because of education and stills training, but that productivity is not matched in their paychecks\n",
      "And I'm running for president because I think that Americans and their families need a champion, and I want to be this champion\n",
      "I want to stand up and fight for people so that they cannot just get by, but they get ahead and they can stay ahead\n",
      "I thought a lot about it and I guess the short answer is I've been fighting for children and families my entire adult life, probably because of my mother's example\n",
      "She had to basically be on her own at the time she was 14 but she just kept going\n",
      "My father, who was a small business man, believed you had to work hard to make your way and do what you had to do to be successful, and provided a good living for our family\n",
      "But I was knocking on doors asking is there anybody school age not in school, and finding blind kids and deaf kids and kids in wheel chairs who were just left out\n",
      "So when I look at where we are as a country, I'm so absolutely convinced that there isn't anybody anywhere who can outcompete us, who has better values, who can do more to provide more people the chance to live up to their own God-given potential\n",
      "So I want to be the champion who goes to bat for Americans in four big areas, four big fights that I think we have to take on, because there are those who don't agree with what I think we should be doing\n",
      "We need to strengthen families and communities because that's where it all starts\n",
      "So with that what I'd love to do is just, you know, ask a few questions and hear\n",
      ": Well, thank you all so much for inviting me here today and giving me a chance to not only learn more about this business, which is a family business, 112 years young\n",
      "And to meet some of the people who work here, as I did when I was walking through, and as you've just introduced yourself\n",
      "I am excited to hear from you about what it takes to get a small business up and going and keep it growing in an increasingly competitive global economy\n",
      "Small business is the backbone of the American economy\n",
      "Here in New Hampshire, 96 percent of all businesses are considered small businesses\n",
      "So New Hampshire is a perfect example of what it takes to start and grow a small business\n",
      "And I come from a small business family\n",
      "My father had a very small business\n",
      "And I saw where now there's a machine that you just bought that's printing on all kinds of material\n",
      "But he made a very good living because of his hard work and his absolute willingness to do whatever it took to design, to produce, to sell the products that were at the heart of what he produced\n",
      "And so from my perspective, I want to be sure that we get small businesses starting and growing in America again\n",
      "I was very surprised to see that when I began to dig into it, because people were telling me this, as I traveled around the country the last two years, but I didn't know what they were saying\n",
      "And it turns out that we're not producing as many small businesses as we used to\n",
      "And a recent world study said that we are 46th in the world in the difficulty to start a small business\n",
      "So I want to hear from each of you, because part of what I'm doing in this campaign is making my own decisions about what we need to do\n",
      "I want to embed what I propose as policies, not in ideology, not in some philosophy, but in the real daily lives and experiences of American workers and business owners and everybody who had a stake in making sure that the economy is working again\n",
      "Really, we have to do more for young people, because what we're finding is that with student debt — and New Hampshire has the highest student debt numbers of any state in the country — that interferes with the young people taking certain jobs, buying a house, even getting married and certainly starting a business\n",
      "He graduated from college, because he'd worked, like you, during the summers, and he — and he wanted to own that business\n",
      "With his student debt, it was really a struggle, because even though he was very responsible, he had done everything we expect a young person to do to try to better himself, he was running into real credit problems\n",
      "And even now, he's got the business, but he runs it — he has a little grill and restaurant, he, with two employees, is trying to make a go of it\n",
      "Here's a young, ambitious guy\n",
      "The other piece of this, as we were walking around and Dave was telling about all of the incredible machines that are used here in production, all but one are from another country\n",
      "Why are they producing these advanced machines instead of us\n",
      "But now it's not enough just to tread water; we need to get ahead and stay ahead, and people need to feel that their work is being rewarded, that the deck is not stacked in favor of those at the top, that they too have a chance to go as far as their hard work and their aspiration will take them\n",
      "And of course, it's no accident that I'm at a  whose customer market is between six months and six years\n",
      "That's — that's right where I am focused these days\n",
      "But I will also stand my ground when we need to, and part of that is getting unaccountable money out of politics, because we cannot afford that, even if it takes a constitutional amendment\n",
      "And the first place I ever came for any political campaign was in 1991 when I was here campaigning for my husband, in October of 1991\n",
      "Well, that's a question near and dear to my heart, because I think every society starts with our youngest citizens\n",
      "And I really applaud states — and they are not — you know, they're not all the states that you might think of — Oklahoma has a universal pre-K program because their state decided they would invest in those early years to get their kids better for school\n",
      "So we've got to do more to support quality child care and universal pre-kindergarten because by the time a child enters kindergarten, a lot of their brain development has taken place, their vocabulary has been developed and so if we want to do well in school — and I know there's a couple teachers or retired teachers out there, you want to have our kids do well in school, it has to start in those first five years and that's where you come in\n",
      "I am — I'm really concerned because, Pam, what you just told me, I'm hearing from a lot of different people\n",
      "You know, the drug abuse problem, whether it's pills or meth or heroin, is not as visible as in, you know, 30 years ago when there were all kinds of gangs and violence\n",
      "And at the same time, we see steady cutbacks in drug abuse programs, treatment programs, mental health programs\n",
      "And I am convinced that the mental health issues — because I consider substance abuse part of mental health issues — is going to be a big part of my campaign because increasingly it's a big issue that people raised with me\n",
      "We have treatment in the Affordable Care Act, which is a good thing, which we — and we have at least on paper, what's called mental health parity, you know, insurance companies have to care of mental health just like they take care of physical problems\n",
      "But we are just at the beginning of trying to figure out what this is, and the whole substance abuse issue — I'll just end with this\n",
      "You probably have read about this small county in Southern Indiana where there was an epidemic of HIV among just people living in the community because they were sharing needles and shooting up some kind of pill that was I guess turned to powder\n",
      "So now they have not only the drug abuse problem, they have people who contracted HIV\n",
      "So this is not something we can just brush under the rug and wish it would go away\n",
      "And I think more young people — maybe because we stopped the messaging about how dangerous drugs work, because I can remember the same kind of, you know, messages advertising that we would see all the time, you don't see that anymore\n",
      "I mean, you know it's a prescription pill so that means it must be OK\n",
      "And they don't know that taking it and mixing it and all the rest is going to be dangerous for them\n",
      "Well, you know, you really raised an important issue because one of the really big problems we face is that American worker productivity has continued to go up\n",
      "And in some cases, where you have small companies, it's— the margin's just too thin\n",
      "In some places where you have big companies, they just choose not to\n",
      "So I think there has to be a look at the range of different kinds of companies because some companies have the cash and they make decisions that leave out their workers and some people are trying just to keep the doors open and the work coming and be successful and stay afloat\n",
      "So what we need to figure out is how we incentivize companies that have the cash to do more with it and how we support smaller businesses to be more competitive, to get more market, especially export market\n",
      "And Dave and I were talking about how important it is for small businesses to have access to market openings\n",
      "I mean, how do you get the best support you need for a website or for you know, telling other potential customers about your product\n",
      "And I don't know how people can make some of the arguments they make, because if you look at how dependent so many people are on their Social Security — they've worked hard for it, they retire, they postpone retirement as long as possible because they want to keep working, but they also want to, you know, get the maximum amount of payout from Social Security\n",
      "You know, the Social Security trust fund, according to the trustees, will be solvent until 2035\n",
      "So what do we do to make sure it is there and we don't mess with it and we don't, you know, pretend that it's a luxury, because it's not a luxury\n",
      "It's just wrong\n",
      "Let's just kind of take a deep breath here as a country and say, OK, we're going to have a retirement issue and people who have worked hard deserve to have enough security when they retire so that they can have a good quality of life\n",
      "So I think that, you know, if you — if you look just realistically, especially if you still own your home, you're still obviously very independent and able to take care of yourself, you are going to have a lot of expenses, both predicted and unpredictable\n",
      "Too many young people don't know — nobody's told them that, you know, you can get a really good job, as you just named, an electrician or a welder, you name it — and the computerized numeric control systems that you're talking about on these big machines, that takes, you know, a year or two of training to really understand, because that's a level beyond what we typically think of as technical education\n",
      "So I would love to hear from you — and maybe start with you, indeed, Chris, because when people come for a job interview, where have they gotten their skills or do they even know that those skills would enhance their chance to get hired\n",
      "Yes, so you have got cost pressures plus skill pressures\n",
      "Well, I think, first of all, we just have to have more programs that are going to prepare more people\n",
      "I mean, that sounds so simplistic, but we kind of backed off from what used to be called vocational education and I think that we made a mistake because we backed off, thinking that it was going to be picked up by either businesses or community colleges, technical schools and that didn't happen fast enough\n",
      "I mean, I'm just thinking that you know, you have this equipment here, if you get some kind of grant or other support from either local government, state government, even the community college or the colleges and you know, you could have a program at night\n",
      "I mean, it — you know, if somebody were to come in and basically say we are going to designate Whitney Brothers as one of our training facilities and your expert employees would get some kind of wage bump because you would be the instructors\n",
      "I just think we've got to be imagining outside the old box about what we're going to do to get our skills up, how we're going to get more people of all ages to have the opportunity to improve those skills\n",
      "I just — from my perspective, I hear it everywhere\n",
      "We have a whole missing group of workers that could be employed you know, in our existing industries, and so how do we fix that\n",
      "Because we don't fix it, we're not going to be able to be competitive\n",
      "And I think if we work in the high schools, even in the grammar schools in some points, you know, get these kids — a lot of kids just don't want to go to school\n",
      "You know, one of the kids that they told me about at this community college, advanced manufacturing program, graduated from high school and got a $40,000 job as a welder because there was such a shortage\n",
      "Well, Dave, we will give you the last word because you have been here — how long have you worked here\n",
      "Yes, no, I think that's an important question and I can assure you that I don't want to make your life any more onerous\n",
      "I think what we have to do is we have to look at the whole tax system and try to figure out what is an economic investment as opposed to one without economic purpose, because there are a lot of those, where people are just basically playing games and — you know, not — you know, like capital gains was supposed to be, for example, a way to reward people who made risky investments, you know, starting new business, investing in somebody else's business and now it's just being churned\n",
      "But I can — I can assure you, I would not support anything that makes your business more difficult to run, because you have a real business and you have real economic imperatives\n",
      "You are in the production of goods and I want to do everything I can to support goods and real services and take a hard look at what is now being done in the trading world, you know, which is just trading for the sake of trading\n",
      "And you know, it's just wrong that you know, a hedge fund manager pays lower tax rates than a nurse or a trucker or an assembly worker here at Whitney Brothers\n",
      "And so I think we have to say, look, if you're doing something which is enhancing the economic productivity of your business and the larger economy, we'll be open to that, but if it's just you know, playing back and forth in the global marketplace to get you know, 0\n",
      "Because that is unfortunately kind of at the root of some of the economic problems that we all remember painfully from '08\n",
      "So I think that, from your perspective, I would want to be a president who made it as easy as possible for you to be as productive and profitable as possible because you've got 40-plus people whose lives and families depend upon that\n",
      "When I was just starting out as a senator, David's door was always open\n",
      "Because surely this is a time when our collective efforts to devise approaches to the problems that still afflict us is more important than ever\n",
      "Yet again a community is reeling, its fault lines laid bare and its bonds of trust and respect frayed\n",
      "And, from Ferguson to Staten Island to Baltimore, the patterns have become unmistakable and undeniable\n",
      "Unarmed and just 12 years old\n",
      "His spine nearly severed while in police custody\n",
      "We have to come to terms with some hard truths about race and justice in America\n",
      "5 million black men are \\missing\\ from their families and communities because of incarceration and premature death\n",
      "There is something wrong when trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve breaks down as far as it has in many of our communities\n",
      "We have allowed our criminal justice system to get out of balance\n",
      "And these recent tragedies should galvanize us to come together as a nation to find our balance again\n",
      "They are compounding the tragedy of Freddie Gray's death and setting back the cause of justice\n",
      "We must urgently begin to rebuild the bonds of trust and respect among Americans\n",
      "Restoring trust in our politics, our press, our markets\n",
      "The inequities that persist in our justice system undermine this shared vision of what America can be and should be\n",
      "I learned this firsthand as a young attorney just out of law school—at one of those law schools that will remain nameless here at Columbia\n",
      "And today they demand fresh thinking and bold action from all of us\n",
      "Today there seems to be a growing bipartisan movement for commonsense reforms in our criminal justice systems\n",
      "But we're beginning to agreeing on this: We need to restore balance to our criminal justice system\n",
      "Now of course it is not enough just to agree and give speeches about it—we actually have to work together to get the job done\n",
      "We need to deliver real reforms that can be felt on our streets, in our courthouses, and our jails and prisons, in communities too long neglected\n",
      "Let me touch on two areas in particular where I believe we need to push for more progress\n",
      "First, we need smart strategies to fight crime that help restore trust between law enforcement and our communities, especially communities of color\n",
      "Across the country, there are so many police officers out there every day inspiring trust and confidence, honorably doing their duty, putting themselves on the line to save lives\n",
      "We can start by making sure that federal funds for state and local law enforcement are used to bolster best practices, rather than to buy weapons of war that have no place on our streets\n",
      "President Obama's task force on policing gives us a good place to start\n",
      "We should make sure every police department in the country has body cameras to record interactions between officers on patrol and suspects\n",
      "And we should listen to law enforcement leaders who are calling for a renewed focus on working with communities to prevent crime, rather than measuring success just by the number of arrests or convictions\n",
      "And today smart policing in communities that builds relationships, partnerships, and trust makes more sense than ever\n",
      "And it shouldn't be limited just to officers on the beat\n",
      "It's an ethic that should extend throughout our criminal justice system\n",
      "Because you cannot talk about smart policing and reforming the criminal justice system if you also don't talk about what's needed to provide economic opportunity, better educational chances for young people, more support to families so they can do the best jobs they are capable of doing to help support their own children\n",
      "Today I saw an article on the front page of USA Today that really struck me, written by a journalist who lives in Baltimore\n",
      "This may not grab headlines, although I was glad to see it on the front page of USA Today\n",
      "But it tells us more than I think we can bear about what we are up against\n",
      "But it was not just two longtime friends catching up with each other\n",
      "It was so clearly sharing what is most important to us, as it is to families everywhere in our country\n",
      "So I don't want the discussion about criminal justice, smart policing, to be siloed and to permit discussions and arguments and debates about it to only talk about that\n",
      "Because that is a symptom, not a cause, of what ails us today\n",

      "I mean that just makes no sense at all to me\n",

      "They do not feel that they belong, or they have any allegiance to the country in which they live and work because they're never fully accepted\n",
      "So this is not just in my view the right thing to do for America\n",
      "If you compare us to other countries that did not take that step, you can see what it's done to them\n",
      "And part of that fear has a reality to it is because if people pay you $6 hour, because you're undocumented\n",
      "So my argument is the quicker we can legalize the people who are here, the better the job market will be for everybody because you will not have a group of people who are taken advantage of and you will not have others who feel as though—and to some extent it's true—are losing jobs because this group that is being taken advantage of is paid so much less and treated so much worse\n",
      "So my argument to people who worry about Comprehensive Immigration Reform and the effect on their jobs, it's just the opposite\n",
      "Then, employers will not be able to violate the laws—the Wage and Hour Laws for example, because they're not dealing with a workforce that is scared to say anything, or even scared to look at the boss when he shows up on the work site\n",
      "So this is about everybody, not just about you and your dad\n",
      "And you make a really strong point because it's so expensive to continue your education that too many kids are feeling—and their parents are feeling it's just beyond their reach\n",
      "So that's why I support President Obama's proposal for free community college which at least get you started and I'd like to look to see how we get the debt under control and give people a chance to, you know, not be burdened by debt which makes it really hard for them to start a business or to continue their education\n",
      "So this is going to be a big part of, you know, my education policy as I go forward in the campaign because you're 100 percent right\n",
      "Too many young people today feel like, you know, it's just out of their reach or they graduate with some much debt they feel like they are paralyzed\n",

      "This is, you know, this sounds a little archane but I want to emphasize how important this is because when you look at high school education, making it possible for more students to have access to advanced placement courses really ups the level of education\n",
      "It gives kids a leg up if they go on to college because they may have some credit before they ever get there\n",
      "But too many kids in the past and still across our country don't take the test because—I don't know what it does today—$80\n",
      "So I want to—I really want to—I don't—I hope that the Rancho administrators are still here because—good\n",
      "I want to give them a big shout out for using Title I funding to make sure every kid who wants to take an A\n",
      "Well, I think it's very shortsighted of us not to legalize students who graduate from college and can use their skills to make a good life for themselves but also to give back\n",
      "We have thousands and thousands of foreign students come to our country every year\n",

      "I want to reiterate my strong support for the president's executive actions because he had to act in the face of inaction that was not on the merits but politically motivated for partisan reasons which I think is not the way we should be solving our problems in our country, in our Congress or anywhere else\n",
      "And I'm so pleased that the congresswoman is here because I know she's a champion for a lot of the issues that we are talking about today\n",
      "And maybe we could get the Rancho—the principal and others to come up and join us, you know\n",
      "Let's get the administrators who invited us all here to come and stand\n",

      "Congresswoman, why don't you join us\n",
      "And Dean and Gary, thank you for welcoming us to your beautiful home; what a delight it is to be here with you\n",
      "And I said, well, yes, it is because not only do I learn a lot but I also feel like it's the best way to make those connections that will not only give me a firm foundation in the caucus here in Iowa or in a primary in New Hampshire—because it really is about people-to-people connections if we're really talking about what we want to do—but it will also give me the kind of information I need to be an even better president\n",
      "And I just had another example about that\n",
      "And I'm so grateful to you for that because it's the kind of discussion that you can't have unless you have an opportunity to actually talk and listen with people\n",
      "They lost houses\n",
      "And I know that, although we have to—it's still hard to imagine exactly how we're going to get to the point where people are not just getting by but getting ahead again and staying ahead because, look, the deck is still stacked in favor of those at the top\n",
      "And so we have to be especially focused on how we're going to bring about the changes that will ignite opportunity for everybody willing to work hard for it again\n",
      "And there are going to be fights, because they're—if they were easy, they would already be done\n",
      "It needs to be sustainable\n",
      "And when you think about value, what it is that's going to get us moving again, I think kindergarten teachers are really important\n",
      "Iowa has really helped us\n",
      "It's also imperative that we give people the tools through education and job training and skills not just in rhetoric but in reality so that they can make the most out of their own lives\n",
      "I have been a child advocate and a child development proponent for my entire adult life because it's what I really care about, what I believe in\n",
      "We have to have universal pre-K but we also have to do more to reach out to families so they know the tools they should use to be their children's first teachers\n",
      "You know, we go and just stare at her\n",
      "And I imagine among her first words were—will be, you know, \\Enough with the reading,\\ because between her mom and her dad and Bill and I, we're constantly doing that\n",
      "But we're doing it not only because we love to do it and we love to see her begin to reach her hands out and grab onto the books, we're doing it because we know that it aids her brain development\n",
      "That will help them be better prepared when they actually end up in kindergarten and it will begin to close the achievement gap because, you know, we're going to do everything we can for our granddaughter\n",
      "Many of us in this room, I bet, as I did, borrowed money to go to college\n",
      "But then we were able to pay it back because it wasn't such an overwhelming burden as it has become now\n",
      "The average student in Iowa graduates with $30,000 in debt and that then makes it very difficult for them to start a business or buy a new home or even get married, as one young man told me not so long ago\n",
      "And that's our second challenge, because a lot of families and communities have been under tremendous strain\n",
      "I don't hear my friends on the other side of the aisle talking as much as they used to about getting rid of the Affordable Care Act\n",
      "I think the reason is is because there are a lot of people that they may actually be encountering from time to time who have been helped\n",
      "That is just unacceptable\n",
      "People aren't talking about it because it's something that is hard to deal with\n",
      "And I just said what I said\n",
      "\\ I have to tell you, when I started running, when I started thinking about this campaign, I did not believe I would be standing in your living room talking about the drug abuse problem, the mental health problem and the suicide problem\n",
      "And we have to try to figure out how we're going to get people to work with us for the betterment of our country, the betterment of people who need a good positive support system, whether it be health care of aid for college, or anything else\n",
      "And I will do everything I can do to appoint supreme court justices who will protect the right to vote, and not the right of billionaires to buy elections\n",
      "and some of them think there may be a way to get legislation through that will enable us to regulate this kind of use of money in our political system which is so corruptive and corrosive\n",
      "But others agree with former Justice John Paul Stevens, who recently wrote a book in which he said it's going to take a constitutional amendment\n",
      "I will work for that if that's the only way to fix this problem, because we cannot continue with the kind of assault on our democracy, on voting rights, and on the opportunity for us to know where the money is coming from that influences our political system\n",
      "Now, for us , we have challenges around the world\n",
      "It's not just dictators\n",
      "Also disease, climate change, which—I think global warming is a threat to us\n",
      "And we must do so in cooperation with our friends, our allies, our fellow democracies around the world\n",
      "So, I know there are a lot of hard choices ahead of us\n",
      "And I have to tell you, I find it, you know, very reassuring because I do have that experience to know what's possible and how best to proceed\n",
      "It is not a time for easy answers or glib answers or one-liners or applause lines\n",
      "I look forward to working with you, not only as we move toward the caucuses\n",
      "And then I will need your help as we move toward the general election because I don't want this election to be about me\n",
      "I want to it to be about us and the agenda that we want to set for our country\n",
      "The Sunday after the election, Bill and I went for a walk in an area that Sarah would know, a big kind of nature preserve near where we both live, and we just wanted to let down because we'd been working so hard to elect then-President-Elect Obama\n",
      "And he just said, \\Don't—don't call me until you say yes\n",
      "\\ And I did tell my husband, I said, \\He's so persistent\n",
      "And I went in part because everybody I called, all of the leaders in the countries that I spoke with, were saying, \\You know, we just don't know whether the United States cares about us anymore; nobody's been paying any attention to us; you know, we're—we're kind of feeling like we're not important to you anymore\n",
      "And one of the countries that I went to was Indonesia, in part because it's a very important country, but also President Obama had a personal connection with it\n",
      "And I thought, \\I have to answer this in a very, you know, serious way that maybe they can understand in our democracy, you know, we do try to close ranks after we have hard elections,\\ at least that's what we should be doing\n",
      "Well first let me thank all of you in particular our round table participants for being with us today and thanks to Bike Tech for welcoming us to this amazing facility\n",
      "I'm delighted to have this chance to talk more about small businesses\n",
      "Because I've always believed fundamentally that when our families are strong, our country is strong\n",
      "Our economy and our country are in much better shape today, and in large measure because families worked so hard\n",
      "I'm running for president because everyday Americans and their families need a champion and I want to be that champion\n",
      "I want families to do more than just get by — I want you to get ahead and stay ahead\n",
      "Now, small businesses like Bike Tech and the ones you'll here about today have to be at the heart of that effort — creating jobs, driving growth, and giving millions of Americans the chance to live up to their God-given potential\n",
      "Now, I did not learn this from politics — I learned it from my father who was a small business man\n",
      "He had a very small business, printing drapery fabrics and then went out and sold them\n",
      "That's what put food on the table and gave us a solid middle class home\n",
      "Today, small businesses all over our country have worked their way back from the perfect storm of the crisis, when sales and credit, together, dried up at the same time\n",
      "Businesses are finally starting to sort out how they can grow again, add jobs, and planning for the future\n",
      "Ask any small business owner, as I have, and they'll tell you: It is wrong that it is so easy for big corporations to get a break but so hard for small businesses even to get a loan\n",
      "It shouldn't take longer to start a business in America than it does in Canada and France\n",
      "I want to be a small business president\n",
      "A president who does make it easier to start and run a small business in this country, so it seems less like a gamble and more like an opportunity\n",
      "We have to level the playing field for our small businesses\n",
      "First, we need to cut the unnecessary red tape that costs small businesses time and money and keeps new entrepreneurs out\n",
      "We should scrub federal regulations to find responsible ways to make life easier for small businesses, and we should offer new incentives to state and local governments to do the same, because that's where many of the obstacles still lie\n",
      "Second, we need to simplify tax filing and provide targeted credits and deductions for small businesses, not just the big corporations that can afford the lawyers and lobbyists to find every single loophole\n",
      "Third, we'll use technology to expand access for small businesses into new markets, whether it's across town, across the state, or across the world\n",
      "We started a public-private partnership to help small businesses that had never sold beyond their local community reach customers very far away\n",
      "Fourth, and I want to emphasize this today, I will fight to level the playing field for small businesses so they can get the financing they need to build and hire… including women and minority entrepreneurs who face extra barriers\n",
      "And this morning when I was reading the Des Moines Register — big head line: REPORT: Iowa Ranks Last for Women Owned Business\n",
      "This could not be a more timely article for our discussion today and although it says Iowa has made some progress it says Iowa has seen the lowest growth in the most businesses owned by women from 1997 to 2015 and women owned companies have the least economic clout in Iowa and all the states and the District of Columbia\n",
      "So this is a very important issue for our whole county but I think it is especially important for our friends here in Iowa because access to credit can be as important to growing a small business as it is for the big ones\n",
      "For many small businesses these loans have always come from community banks with deep local ties\n",
      "And when it gets harder for small banks to do their jobs it gets harder for small businesses to get their loans\n",
      "Let's be clear about this: It's not the big banks that need relief from Washington — it's small banks and small businesses\n",
      "I fully support the regulations in Dodd-Frank on the big banks but we should pass common sense community banking reform right now, however, the republicans in the congress insist on using this issue to give relief to community banks as a Trojan Horse for rolling back the protections for consumers and rolling back the rules for the big banks — as we're seeing right now in what Republicans are introducing — we should call it what it is: a cynical attempt to game the system for those at the top\n",
      "Our goal should be helping community banks serve their neighbors and customers the way they always have\n",
      "To make it easier to give our responsible loans to responsible small businesses so they can do what they do best, create jobs and help families get ahead\n",
      "What more can we do to help small businesses grow\n",
      "I want to thank everyone at New Horizons for welcoming us to this facility\n",
      "I want to say just a few words about what's happening with our economy and more broadly about America's families\n",
      "Because I think when our families are strong America is strong\n",
      "And if we don't have strong families its really hard for us to be the kind of strong nation that sets the table for our children to do better\n",
      "The great recession just really knocked people to the ground\n",
      "And we are in much better shape today in large measure because families made the sacrifice and worked really hard despite the odds\n",
      "Now I happen to think that kindergarten teachers and child care providers and child development specialists are really important because they are the people that are helping to get our kids off to a good start working with families\n",
      "And I'm running for President because I think everyday Americans need a champion, a champion that gets up every single day and goes to work and goes to bat and does everything I can to help families just get by which is what you were talking about\n",
      "And 40 percent of moms, just like LaKeisha, are now the sole or the primary breadwinners in their household\n",
      "Yet we haven't adjusted our economy or our government programs to take those differences into account\n",
      "You know I can remember very well when I was a young lawyer before I had my daughter in my law firm where I worked in Arkansas, around 3 o'clock I'd see all the women who worked there sort of whispering into their phones and I didn't know why, but it was just like clockwork, well they were trying to make sure their kids got home safely because their kids were walking home or getting off the bus and going home waiting for mom to get home\n",
      "But that kind of juggling act is what most of us do all the time now and therefore we have to adjust how we support families so that you can be the best you can be and how we support small businesses like so many child care providers so you can make a living while you do what you love\n",

      "And we, you know, we started a fund called the Arkansas Single Parent Scholarship Fund, because it wasn't the money that they needed so much for the tuition, although that was a stretch, it was all the other expenses that surrounded the difficulty of them being able to get their education\n",
      "What can the—you know, houses of worship, our churches, do\n",
      "And it's particularly important for the youngest kids, the zero to three kids, because those are kids who need a lot more personal attention\n",
      "You know, Bill and I are exhausted every time we take care of Charlotte\n",
      "But again, we need more people to help fill that space because that's often where parents really are stretched, and we also don't have a lot of time off for a lot of working parents And so, just getting everything organized, when you have that new baby is a challenge, don't you think\n",
      "Well, that's why I said I'm going to offer a middle-class tax cut that can go toward helping parents pay for quality child care, because you've put your finger on one the biggest problems\n",
      "And a lot of them just throw up their hands\n",
      "They just—I mean, they're making $8, $9, $10 an hour for often 12-hour days\n",
      "And that is just a huge burden on them and their family\n",
      "And that's one of the reasons why if you followed my campaign—because of what I've been hearing, because I have spent two months listening to people, because I do think it's important, when you want to represent the entire country, you actually listen to what's happening in people's lives\n",
      "And substance abuse and addiction is ravaging families all over the country\n",
      "First of all, I'm going to talk a lot about it, because we need to drag it out of shadows\n",
      "And—and—and then it's heartbreaking, because there has not been an event I've got to, where somebody hasn't come up to me, sometimes bravely, like you did in public, and sometimes just privately taking me aside to talk to me about it\n",
      "you think about how hard it is, and you're grandchildren will be really better off because their grandmother stepped in and said, \\I'm here for you, and I will take care of you\n",
      "\\ Secondly, we have to—we have to extend every program, every tax—everything we do to people taking care of kids, whether they are parents or they are grandparents or maybe, in some cases, older siblings or aunts or uncles, because of the inability of a child's parents to be able to do so\n",
      "I mean, when you're—look, I just --we were just laughing about, you know, my eight-month old is beginning, you know, heave herself around in the resemblance of a crawl\n",
      "You know, when I was a senator, I championed a program in New York City to have a special form of housing for grandmothers raising their kids, because they needed, in my view, the support of a community\n",
      "Because it can be really isolating\n",
      "I mean, most of your friends, you know, they're not raising babies, toddlers or school-age kids, so you need the support of a broader community to help you with that, and you need the support that any parent would get, because that's what you're doing, you're parenting\n",
      "So I can tell you that I will do everything I can, both in any benefit that I think the country should extend to raising children, you will be eligible, but also to the idea of how do we provide support for you and for other grandmothers, because it's predominantly grandmothers\n",
      "You need to support each other because you need to get that, you know, that emotional support and the—and the—and the hints and the tips, like, you know, somebody finds out something that'll work for them, it may work for you\n",
      "Well, this is one of the—you know, the key issues about how we do more do adapt our school system to spark the ability to learn in every kind of kid, because kids learn differently\n",
      "So, the specific issue about ADHD kids is we need to make sure we have the best possible diagnosis and treatment, because we are medicating lots of kids\n",
      "And I think we have to ask ourselves: Are we medicating those kids because they have a medical condition that needs to be medicated\n",
      "But are we medicating kids because we've not yet figured out how to better deal with their particular needs\n",
      "And that starts in the family, because it, you know, it's hard for a lot of families, but it also goes into the schools\n",
      "I think we made an error when we eliminated in high school, in most high schools, technical education, what we used to call vocational education\n",
      "I think, you know, there are—we're going to need a lot of jobs that are good jobs, by people who can do work that is not just academic work\n",
      "And the ones who were seniors had jobs lined up, starting to pay, like, $40,000 because they were coming out as a certified machinist\n",
      "Because I do believe that for kids, especially ADHD kids, doing something, not trying to sit still, which is really hard, but getting up and learning, you know, going from machine to machine to figure out how it works, if that's their interest\n",
      "Bush with No Child Left Behind, it was certainly well-motivated\n",
      "And I say all of this because we've always spent money on our military, you know, depending upon who's in and who's out, greater or lesser amounts\n",
      "And just like every other part of government, it needs to be looked at hard, so that we don't just send money, without getting the results that we need\n",
      "So we've got to adjust how we fund even defense, but we have to always fund it\n",
      "I just want to give you a—and I'm going to roll out a whole education proposal, too\n",
      "You know, everybody believes, and I'm guilty of this, that we're an expert about education, because we went to school\n",
      "And those of us who are parents, we had kids in school, so we think we got it all figured out\n",
      "We know what worked or didn't work for us and, therefore, we kind of translate that into what will or won't work for other people\n",
      "We have so much research, it matters, because, you know, for many of this in room, summertime, you give your kids new experiences\n",
      "Maybe they—maybe you take them on trips, where they go to museums\n",
      "A longer school day for a lot of kids makes a lot of sense, because if you have kids particularly in the pre-teen, early-teen years, and they get out of school before parents get home from work, that is one of the worst times of the day for kids to get themselves in trouble\n",
      "Because if parents don't understand what their kids are supposed to be learning and they don't reinforce it, it's really hard for teachers to make that case\n",
      "So I think that we can do a better job in using the money we spend on education more effectively and trying to figure out where at state and local levels more expenditures would make a difference\n",
      "And I'm very open to that because it breaks my heart that in a lot of poor districts right now, those poor schools have lost every extracurricular activity\n",
      "And so, when you cut out all of those programs and you just say, \\You've got to do well on these tests\\ that are taught in a certain way, to be learned in a certain way, a lot of kids are not gonna be able to grasp that and do well\n",
      "So that's what I want to see us do more of, so\n",
      "Because if you look at the highest-performing nations, Finland is usually at the top\n",
      "And yes, they don't start school until kids are seven, but those kids have not just been wandering around fending for themselves\n",
      "They've been in organized settings, predominantly family-based, but not exclusively\n",
      "I just—in the classroom where I just was, I was handed this book of drawings\n",
      "That is just as important as anything else you can do in the classroom\n",
      "We can't just say it doesn't matter whether kids learn anything\n",
      "So I want to—I want to give our two guests, if I can, the chance for the last word, because they—they've been on the front lines\n",

      "Well, you know, Martin, it's not only Iran that is invested, we're—obviously it's now becoming public, we are learning much more about Russian investment, Russian troops on the ground\n",
      "It may very well be opening the door to greater Russian involvement\n",
      "There is no doubt that Russian has—Russia has been a principal funder and supplier throughout this entire terrible episode\n",
      "So we are facing the collapse of Syria, the survival thus far of the Assad regime, although it clearly has much less to govern than it did when this started, the open ungoverned areas that are hosting terrorist groups and the continuing commitment from Iran and Russia to propping up Assad\n",
      "So I—you know, I was the principal negotiator on the Geneva 2012 agreement, which Russia signed onto, which laid out a pathway to a political solution\n",
      "It wasn't very long until Russia reneged on what they had signed\n",
      "So I think we—my view on this is we have to be talking, and pushing on, and raising the cost for Iran and for Russia all the time\n",
      "You can never be more extreme than the next extremist and I think they face some very serious internal problems, as do the other regimes\n",
      "However, having said that, I still think we have to do what we need to do to defend them because the alternatives are hardly more promising\n",
      "As I write in my book, you know, certainly Prime Minister Netanyahu and I have had very rigorous conversations that have gone on in person and over the phone\n",
      "But I—I just don't think it's a particularly productive approach for the United States to take because in large measure, it opens the door to everybody else to delegitimize Israel to, you know, pile on in ways that are not good for the—the strength and stability, not just of Israel obviously but of the region\n",
      "And so, in the absence of you know, some kind of greater goal that we were trying to achieve by doing that I just don't think that is the smartest approach\n",
      "And I—and I would because I think that we have to attempt to do that, you know\n",
      "We still had the P5-plus-1 that was going on and we knew that eventually whatever the United States did would have to merge into the international approach\n",
      "That's when we had the first, you know, visit to discuss anything could be possible\n",
      "It takes awhile, as you know so well, being such an expert in this region, to figure out who's at the table, what the conversation's about, how seriously it will be taken, who's backing you up\n",
      "And so, then when the—the talks actually started, just in the Iranian-American channel with Bill Burns and Jake Sullivan and Bob Einhorn was also involved\n",
      "It was—it was exploratory and it laid down some of the—the ground rules that we were looking for, and then eventually it was merged into the larger P5-plus-1 once there was a change in government in Iran and there was some real seriousness of effort\n",
      "So with respect to the other issues, I—I—I have very clearly, in the public arena, seen the Iranians at the highest levels reject any such discussion\n",
      "You know, number one, it appeared to us in the early discussions with them, trying to figure out how to proceed\n",
      "That's why we kept very focused on just the nuclear program\n",
      "We also had the continuing challenge, and it would be even in this instance, of our friends in the Gulf not wanting us to talk about anything that affected them in a bilateral channel with the Iranians, and you can understand why\n",
      "So if there were a way to construct such a—a channel, I would be open to it, but I'm just laying out some of the difficulties of us being able to do that on this suite of other issues that are complex that touch many of the—the region's vital interests\n",
      "And—and I think when it comes to Syria, we have historically not wanted to talk to Iran about Syria because we knew Iran was basically the principal supporter, propper up if you will, of Assad and we wanted to get the rest of the international community in harness to have a set of expectations and demands before we brought Iran in\n",
      "So we have to—you know, we have to readjust this all the time\n",
      "Just as I said, diplomacy is the balancing of risk, it's also the—the constant evaluation of where the opportunities are, where the openings are, what possibly could happen now that didn't happen before\n",
      "But it was—it was aimed at, what could you do to up the cost on Russia, for example, to be a more productive partner in seeking a solution\n",
      "And we see that everyday with the refugees because it's humanitarian but it's also a security challenge as well\n",
      "Well, you know, I—I have been—I remain convinced that we need a concerted effort to really up the costs on Russia, and in particular on Putin\n",
      "I am in the category of people who wanted us to do more in response to the annexation of Crimea and the continuing destabilization of Ukraine\n",
      "The sanctions came out of the all discussions and you know, maybe to some extent they have had you know, some impact\n",
      "We all wish that Putin would choose to modernize his country and move toward the west, instead of you know, sinking himself deeper into you know, historical roots of czar-like behavior and intimidation along borders, and projecting Russian power in places like Syria and elsewhere\n",
      "And I believe that we've got to regroup—we've got to regroup quickly, because I worry very much about what's happening in Syria right now\n",
      "What is Russia's real objective\n",
      "Because after Assad there would be terrorism\n",
      "Now, obviously if we had a different approach from the beginning working together we might've avoided this\n",
      "All the—you know, all the Russian experts that you know, that thought that their work was done after the fall of the Berlin Wall, I hope that they will be dusting off their materials and I'm looking right at Strobe Talbott, and you know, get back in the game with us\n",
      "Because, I think Russia's objectives are to stymie and to confront and to undermine American power whenever and wherever they can\n",
      "We got cooperation on Iran because when we got the Security Council to pass the sanctions that we had been working so hard on, that was under Medvedev in June of 2010\n",
      "We got support to ship lethal material and equipment across to Russia to resupply our troops\n",
      "So, to answer the question of the—of the woman who asked, we have to do more to get back talking about how we try to confine, contain, deter Russian aggression in Europe and beyond\n",
      "And try to figure out what are the best tools for doing that and don't lose sight of the architect because we're going to have a lot of issues up there well\n",
      "My phone calls to them before I ever went to the region in February of 2009, you know, they—they believed that because we were focused in Afghanistan and we were so focused in Iraq, and obviously had to be given all that we had invested there, that we were just not paying attention to the developments in Asia\n",
      "You know, it was a lot easier in a bipolar world, us versus the Soviet Union, I understand that, but I think we really have to work at it\n",
      "He wanted to show support for the president's policy of taking some limited military action in light of Syria's use of chemical weapons\n",
      "I do think that not being able to follow through on it cost us\n",
      "That still comes back in conversations that people have with me, both here at home and—and people from other countries, but I do think it was a net positive to get as much of the chemical weapons out as we could, and there was no way we could have done that without Russian cooperation\n",
      "I think there was hope after that kind of cooperation produced positive results that then, we could go back to talking more broadly with the Russians about what needed to be done in Syria and what needed to be done with Assad\n",
      "I think, even though it's not on our doorstep, we have a real interest in working not just with our European friends, I think this is a global responsibility\n",
      "I obviously want the United States to do our part but I also want this to be a global response\n",
      "So I hope that with all these leaders gathered, with Pope Francis addressing the United Nations General Assembly in just about two weeks, we can see something like that very visible with people literally making their commitments nation by nation, or in the case of the EU or other organizations as well\n",
      "But let's just go back a few years\n",
      "Then came the flotilla and then came the response by the Israeli military, then came many years of you know, real hard feelings that got harder and harder and we lost what was a—not just a - a working relationship but a real bridge\n",
      "Israel is now back in a very productive relationship with Egypt, obviously with Jordan\n",
      "So there are the pieces of national and regional interests here that I think very diligently and probably frustratingly could be pulled back together\n",
      "And I think there is potential there because as I said in my speech, I will do everything I can to convince Turkey and (Qatar) that supporting Hamas is not in their interest\n",
      "I was talking to everybody I could find to make the strategic argument which we all believed, that the sooner Israel did that, the sooner they could get back to some kind of discussion perhaps\n",
      "So I would like to see us do everything we can\n",
      "I hope that this administration in the last, you know, year-and-a-half or so of it, term, will be similarly doing that because, let's start seeing what we can do\n",
      "Just as I said in my remarks, there are people who I deeply respect on the Democratic side certainly and I would respect them on the Republican side as well, who just have concerns that they don't feel have been answered\n",
      "Just as we, and I'll end with this by saying, just as we have to in diplomacy, reach out to people constantly, if not to persuade them to join with us, to eliminate an argument that they have, that they won't join, because they have been consulted\n",
      "But we still have to do it so we can be in the position of saying, you know, \\We told you this, we offered you this, we briefed you this, we gave you this information and you haven't come forth with any kind of, you know, rational, or rationale to oppose us\n",
      "You're just opposing us\n",
      "In a CNN exclusive, the Democratic presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, joins us now live\n",
      "Madam Secretary, thanks very much for joining us\n",
      "You know, Wolf, I didn't get to see all of their debate, but I saw enough of it to know that this is just the usual back and forth political attacks, the kinds of things you say when you're on a debate stage and you really don't have much else to say\n",
      "They're all trying to vie for more attention from, obviously, the Republican Party\n",
      "You know, this is just the silly season\n",
      "Well, Wolf, let's—let's break down what's happening here, because I think it's important\n",
      "There's a lot of accusations that are being hurled about\n",
      "If it's the services that they are trying to shut down, like providing family planning or breast cancer screenings, that is just wrong and women deserve to be given support to get those services provided\n",
      "If they want to shut down the legal provision of abortion services, then they've got a bigger problem, because, obviously, they—Planned Parenthood does not use federal dollars to do that\n",
      "And if they are more focused on the research that is going on, then that's a set of issues that certainly is not only about Planned Parenthood\n",
      "—that the Republicans, and particularly the Republicans in the House, led by Speaker Boehner, would not put our country and our economy in peril pursuing some kind of emotionally politically charged partisan attack on Planned Parenthood to shut our government down\n",
      "Well, you know, I was trying to explain, uh, what had happened and obviously it was clear that I should have used two different email accounts and I said that that was a mistake, I'm sorry, I've taken responsibility\n",
      "But I will tell the American people I believe that my set of experiences, my plans for the future, my vision for what America should be, what I've already told voters I would do on everything from making college affordable to paying down student debt to tackling climate change by making us the clean energy superpower, dealing with substance abuse and addiction, like I did here in New Hampshire today\n",
      "I'm the one out there talking very specifically about what I would do because I want to run a campaign that lays out my agenda, because when I get elected, I'm going to start working on it immediately\n",
      "I look forward to the debate, you know, next month, you know, now just a month away\n",
      "And I will certainly show up anywhere the Democratic National Committee tells us to show up, because I want us to have a good exchange of ideas and to make sure that Democratic voters first, and then general voters to follow, see exactly what we each stand for and what our positions are\n",
      "I think if you look at the last 35 years, actually, if you go back further, I think it's pretty indisputable that having a Democrat in the White House is good for our economy, better for our economy than the alternative\n",
      "I think my husband understood that and produced\n",
      "I think President Obama inherited a—a really big and dangerous mess and has, you know, been able to get us out of that ditch\n",
      "So I'm not running for my husband's third term\n",
      "And I would like to see us move from what is a good start with 10,000 to 65,000, and begin immediately to put into place the mechanisms for vetting the people that we would take in, looking to really emphasize some of those who are most vulnerable, a lot of the persecuted religious minorities, including Christians, and some who have been brutalized, like the Yazidi women\n",
      "A lot of these rebels, originally, they were—they were businesspeople, they were professional people, they were students\n",
      "They had no training in going up against the Syrian army, which Assad clearly was going to use to the ultimate effect\n",
      "You have Iran and Russia increasingly moving in to support Assad and his constant bombardment against his own people\n",
      "Well, I hope we're not turning to the Russians\n",
      "Let me just quickly say that I wouldn't give up on train and equip, but I sure would push the Pentagon to take hard look why what has been done has been such a failure and what more we could do to support, like, Kurdish fighters who are on the front lines\n",
      "I hope we are not turning to the Russians in that way\n",
      "Russia has a long interest in Syria\n",
      "They have a connection because a lot of Syrians were educated in the Cold War in Moscow and a lot of Russians actually moved to Syria\n",
      "And I want to just end by saying, if they are providing any equipment to Hezbollah, if they are supporting Hezbollah, which is the main fighting force on behalf of the Iranians to support Assad, but also a deadly threat to Israel, then we have got to take action, whether there are tougher sanctions or other kinds of actions to try to prevent that from happening\n",
      "I think it's a complicated question, because, of course, 9/11 happened\n",
      "And then I do give President Bush credit for trying to bring the country together around the threats that we did face\n",
      "But we live in a dangerous world\n",
      "This is a dangerous world\n",
      "And I think what we had to do during that period of time, in trying to protect our people after the attack on the consulate, getting them evacuated, not only working on what was going on in Libya, because, remember, we had embassies that were under attack or threatened to attack by terrorist groups across North Africa, indeed, across a much larger swathe of the world\n",
      "I immediately asked for an independent review, just like former secretaries of state did\n",
      "Well, I just don't think that's fair\n",
      "There were two things going on simultaneously\n",
      "Well, all I can tell you, I never felt any political pressure or did I feel any political reason to do anything other than what we tried to do, which was to immediately deal with the problems that were coming at us\n",
      "I should have used two separate e-mail accounts, one personal, one work-related\n",
      "People in the government certainly knew that I was using a personal e-mail\n",
      "And that includes releasing 55,000 pages, which is unprecedented—nobody else that I'm aware of has ever done that—plus turning over the server, plus testifying at the end of October\n",
      "And when we were asked to help the State Department make sure they had everything from other secretaries of state, not just me, I'm the one who said, OK, great, I will go through them again\n",
      "And, in fact, I gave so many that were not work-related, just to be as comprehensive as possible, they are already sending back about 1,200 of them\n",
      "Well, you know, I'm sorry that I made a choice that has raised all of these questions, because I don't like reading that people have questions about what I did and how I did it\n",
      "We got a new arms treaty with Russia\n",
      "And I want that to be the focus of what people know about my tenure at the State Department\n",
      "And let me just say that, yes, when I did it, it was allowed, it was above board\n",
      "Well, of course not, because we all have supporters who may say things that we don't agree with\n",
      "That's obviously fair game\n",
      "But to play into some of the worst impulses that people have these days that are really being lit up by the Internet and other conspiracy-minded theories is just irresponsible\n",
      "No, we're not, because this is such a personal decision\n",
      "And he's obviously considering what he wants to do, including whether he wants to run\n",
      "And I just have the greatest respect and affection for him\n",
      "And I think everybody just ought to give him the space to decide what is best for him and his family\n",
      "I respect his enthusiastic and intense advocacy of his ideas\n",
      "And I hope people who support me respect that, because this is a serious election\n",
      "I obviously am running because I think it's better for the country if a Democrat who has the kind of approaches and values that my husband had and Barack Obama has follows this presidency\n",
      "You know, 158 million American women are no longer charged more for health care because of our gender\n",
      "And to shut down the government, which some Republicans are advocating, over funding for Planned Parenthood, which takes care of millions of women's health needs, is just the height of irresponsibility\n",
      "The fact is that, if we want to have a debate in this country about whether we should continue using—or doing fetal research, then it's not only Planned Parenthood that should be involved in that debate\n",
      "And, obviously, it's really emotional\n",
      "I think that the kind of late-term abortions that take place are because of medical necessity\n",
      "And that's why I have an economic policy that is centered on raising incomes, because I think what we inherited from the Bush administration, what President Obama had to deal with had the potential of becoming a great depression, not just a great recession\n",
      "I want to go back to economic policies where we create millions of new jobs and where people's incomes rise not just at the top, but in the middle and at the bottom, like they did under my husband\n",
      "But they need to be put on notice that any of their behaviors that impact Main Street, that disrupt the kind of orderly processing of financial transactions because high-frequency trading is now going to be making decisions in nanoseconds, or fooling around, as they did in the '80s, in packaging mortgage securities in a way that really bombed us into the great resection, I don't think any financial institution, not just banks, because I think it's important to recognize there are a lot of financial institutions\n",
      "Just three\n",
      "I mean, look, I am a real person, with all the pluses and minuses that go along with being that\n",
      "Madam Secretary, thank you for joining us\n",
      "So I have said also that if I had to do it all over again I would have used a separate e-mail account\n",
      "Well, everything that we had access to was certainly out there and the reason we know about the e-mail chain with General Petraeus is because it was on a government server\n",
      "I wasn't that focused on my e-mail account to be clear here\n",
      "It is the system that my husband's personal office used when he got out of the White House so it was sitting there in the basement\n",
      "And I think it's also fair to say that there are some things about this that I just can't control\n",
      "I relied on people who were and we have done everything we could in response to the State Department asking us to do this review because they asked all the former secretaries\n",
      "And the reason they asked, Chuck, is because they found gaps in their own recordkeeping\n",
      "You know, my assumption—because this system was there before I became secretary—it was there when I left—my assumption was anything that I sent to a dot-gov account would be captured\n",
      "And it got us to the same place—we looked through everything, we gave them everything work-related\n",
      "In fact, we gave them so much they've already told us they're sending back 1,200 because they were clearly personal and not work related\n",
      "It's totally ridiculous\n",
      "That's how the Benghazi Committee got the e-mails even before we went through our exhaustive process\n",
      "Now I have—as you're rightly pointing out—been involved from the receiving side in a lot of these accusations\n",
      "But what I have tried to do in explaining this is to provide more transparency and more information than anybody that I'm aware of has ever served in the government and I'm happy to do that because I want these questions to be answered\n",
      "The Justice Department has the e-mails, they have the server\n",
      "All I can tell you is that when my attorneys conducted this exhaustive process I did not participate\n",
      "As I just said, over 1,200 of the e-mails that we were overly inclusive in trying to be comprehensive the State Department has said we don't want these\n",
      "So when that process finished, you know, my attorney said what do you want us to do with all these personal e-mails\n",
      "I just said I don't need them\n",
      "Whatever happened to them happened to them and I'm very sure that my attorneys did the most meticulous job that could have been done\n",
      "But I also hope people will look at my life long advocacy for kids and families and women and look at what I'm proposing, the vision I have for the country to move forward on everything from raising incomes to equal pay for equal work to getting the cost of college down to dealing with high prescription drug costs—that's what I hope people focus on and people get to make their minds up\n",
      "Well, first of all, I love my husband and he does get upset when I am attacked\n",
      "And then when I ran for the Senate people said, hey, we are more concerned about what you're going to do for us\n",
      "And I trust the voters to make that decision this time around, too\n",
      "I believe that marriage is not just a bond but a sacred bond between a man and a woman\n",
      "I oppose it because I don't think it's in the best interests of what we need to do to combat climate change\n",
      "Well, I just don't think that reflects either my assessment of issues and I don't think it reflects how people who are thoughtful actually conduct their lives\n",
      "And what I've always tried to do is just say ok, what is the best decision that I can think about making\n",
      "It certainly became a very clear mistake when you saw the way the Bush administration conducted that war and the decisions that they made\n",
      "And I'm thrilled now that it's the law of the land and I have a lot of good friends who are now able to be married because of the changes we've made legally and constitutionally\n",
      "I did feel that I shouldn't jump in before the President and Secretary Kerry and make my views known because they're still in the middle of that process\n",
      "We did not have the full understanding of how the particular oil that would have been extracted from those tar sands was of a different degree of dirtiness and polluting in terms of greenhouse gases\n",
      "I can just tell you that I am not someone who stakes out a position and holds it regardless of the evidence or regardless of the way that I perceive what's happening in the world around me\n",
      "So I want people—because I think my experience on these issues is much more reflective of how people talk to me about how they, too, have evolved and moved in their understanding and I feel very comfortable saying that\n",
      "First of all, thank you for joining us\n",
      "I really like to take people back through the history and point out that, when President Obama took office, we were losing 800,000 jobs a month, and we could have literally fallen into a great depression, not just a great recession\n",
      "And because of the hard work of the American people and the president's leadership, we got out of that big ditch\n",
      "We have to continue and win the fight to raise the minimum wage because it's disgraceful the people that work full time in America are still in poverty\n",
      "We have to incentivize more profit sharing so the productivity that leads to profitability doesn't just all show up in the paychecks of CEOs but is shared broadly\n",
      "So we have a very robust agenda that builds on top of layers on top of the progress that we have made under President Obama\n",
      "You know, everywhere I go to speak around the country, I talk about the mess that President Obama inherited from his Republican predecessors, not unlike although much worse than what my husband inherited from his Republican predecessors\n",
      "So people who have supported President Obama are, you know, very enthusiastic and I'm grateful for that in support of my candidacy\n",
      "So whatever differences we have on the Democratic side, which we will be exploring in the debate to give people a chance to make up their minds among us, it is really not at all the kind of gulf between us and the Republicans\n",
      "Just between us, well, you know, I don't know\n",
      "You know, I have said repeatedly that this is a very hard time for the vice president for all the obvious reasons any of us can understand\n",
      "I kind of view that as a badge of respect actually, because they know that I will never give in to their, you know, very poor ideas about the economy or anything else\n",
      "I'm going to work as hard as I can to make the case in the Iowa caucus and then in the New Hampshire primary\n",
      "People didn't think I could win the New Hampshire primary last time after I didn't win the Iowa caucus\n",
      "But I think at the end of the day when I put forth, you know, my views about what the country should be doing and it is in conjunction with my experience and I think my ability, my determination, my tenacity to get things done, people will respond to that, caucus for me and vote for me\n",
      "I think it's dangerous, his demagoguery is no longer amusing\n",
      "He may be the flamboyant front-runner, but his views on immigration, his views on women, his views on Muslims, his views on a long list of issues are not that different from the either stated or unstated views of everybody on the Republican side\n",
      "You know, I find that so insulting, so demeaning and condescending, it's the kind of language we've heard not only from Jeb Bush, we heard it from Mitt Romney\n",
      "It's insulting in the most fundamental way because when we as Democrats say, hey, we want equal pay for equal work, we want to raise the minimum wage, we want to make sure people get the best education they can, that college is affordable, that's to build people up\n",
      "I was just outraged about it\n",
      "And I addressed systemic racism and failures of our justice system, and called for body cameras on every police officer, called for an end to mass incarceration\n",
      "And I think with the policing commission that President Obama commissioned, we have good ideas on all of that, that shouldn't just sit on a shelf, we should be implementing\n",
      "I've met with some of them, I've certainly been made aware of all the meetings my staff has been having with a lot of the advocates, because we have to restore fundamental faith in our democracy and equal treatment under the law\n",
      "And that's a rebuke to all of us\n",
      "And I'm going to do everything I can to restore trust and confidence and respect by changing behaviors and by holding them accountable, you know\n",
      "We need to make sure that the civil rights division and the justice department is fully staffed and able to provide a clear look at any issue that needs to be referred to the federal government\n",
      "And people of color, poor communities, lots of towns and cities, including this great city of New York, were under tremendous pressure because there was so much crime, gangs were warring in the streets, crack houses were endemic, crack babies were filling, you know, the wards of our hospitals\n",
      "I want us to get back to sensible, smart gun prevention of violence\n",
      "I want us to have not just universal background checks, but I want us to really have the country rise up against the special interests lobby of the NRA that believes anybody should have a gun, regardless of their past history, regardless of whether they're domestic violence abuser\n",
      "This is just unsustainable, and we need to stand against it and I'm willing to take them on\n",
      "Because I know that guns are at the root of so much of the crime and the danger that stalks our neighborhoods\n",
      "But our prisons and jails are filled with people who have mental health challenges, people who have substance abuse challenges\n",
      "I want a much more robust diversionary program\n",
      "I want us to do more on treatment\n",
      "I think I may be the first presidential candidate at least in a long time who has a whole policy on substance abuse because this is at the root, you know\n",
      "Let's focus on the bad actors that we don't want setting up crack houses again that you have to go and try to close or joining gangs that are so deadly people are dying across the streets in the country\n",
      "He's from neighboring Vermont—the reviews obviously very positive from many pundits\n",
      "I'm wondering what the pundit in chief, your husband\n",
      "And I think that's the highest praise that I can ever get, because there's nobody who—whose opinion on these kinds of things I respect more\n",
      "We had just celebrated our 40th anniversary on Sunday last\n",
      "And I think he is raising issues that the electorate, not just Democrats, everybody needs to be thinking about\n",
      "And just think of the difference between us and the Republicans, who have put forth nothing but the same old out-of-touch, out-of-date policies\n",
      "Well, his—he has a very ambitious and expansive view about what he thinks should be done with respect to free college and other of the policies that we both are trying to tackle\n",
      "I believe that my approach, for example, on college, I call it the New College Compact, because I think everybody should have some skin in the game, including students, who I say should work for part of their education\n",
      "Maybe it's because I did and my husband did, but I think it's something that you want young people to feel really committed to\n",
      "And I'm hoping that whatever network hosts them, whoever the moderator happens to be, that they will really ask us to explain and contrast\n",
      "And the differences between us is nothing like the differences we all have with the Republicans\n",
      "Obviously, I have\n",
      "When I was secretary of state, I had very high support and approval from Republicans, not just the Republican voters, but Republican officeholders\n",
      "And I'm just reminding people that, you know, you can be an adversary in politics, but then you do have to come together and figure out how to solve problems\n",
      "I have a lot of experience with and respect for people who own guns, collect guns, use them for hunting, use them for target shooting\n",
      "And for the NRA to take these absolute positions on behalf of the most extreme of their members and carrying water for gun manufacturers and dealers is just wrong\n",
      "But what I don't get is why we can't have sensible gun safety measures to keep guns out of the hands of fugitives and stalkers and felons and people with serious mental illness and domestic abusers, the people who should not have them in the first place\n",
      "It happened obviously again when I ran for president\n",
      "There isn't anybody, anybody that I know in politics who hasn't changed a position from time to time, except some Republicans who are impervious to evidence and changed circumstances\n",
      "And it's just unacceptable, what he let be said about the president\n",
      "I will not sit here today and say what I would do upon taking office because, again, we want to bring our troops home\n",
      "I think it's pretty clear that whatever they might have thought they were doing, they ended up becoming a partisan arm of the Republican National Committee with an overwhelming focus on trying to as they admitted drive down my poll numbers\n",
      "I testified to the best of my ability before the Senate and the House\n",
      "Other committees of the Congress, standing committees with other experienced members of staff have all looked into this and basically just rejected the conspiracy theories that are still floating out there in some circles\n",
      "Not at the political level, because I don't think a secretary of state who may be there for four years or two years should be reaching down in and making those decisions\n",
      "Well, that is just a very strong difference of opinion\n",
      "And it is almost an impossible standard because we had two separate systems\n",
      "Others in our government have done the same thing at very high levels, because the rules did change after I left State Department\n",
      "But I would not expect you to be in a position to classify anything because you were not in that classification process\n",
      "It was not in the category of anything that could be classified because it came from an outside nongovernment person passing on what somebody told somebody told him\n",
      "And I just keep going back to we have two different systems\n",
      "I dealt with classified information very carefully and seriously\n",
      "I usually met with people to discuss it\n",
      "And then when I traveled, I had one of those tents because we were afraid of prying eyes from certain governments that I would read classified material in\n",
      "I might make use of it\n",
      "We have got another exclusive interview for you good people this morning, this one with Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, fresh off a widely lauded debate performance watched by a record-setting 15 million people, enough to put her back on top in New Hampshire, according to one poll, where Bernie Sanders had pulled ahead of her in recent months\n",

      "There was no easy way to get him into Benghazi to begin gathering information and meeting those Libyans who were rising up against the murderous the dictator Qadhafi, but he found a way to get himself there on a Greek cargo ship, just like a 19th century American envoy\n",
      "It is a testament to the relationships that he built in Libya that on the day following the awareness of his death, tens of thousands of Libyans poured into the streets in Benghazi\n",
      "Losing any one of them, as we did in Iraq, Afghanistan, Mexico, Haiti, and Libya during my tenure, was deeply painful for our entire State Department and USAID family, and for me personally\n",

      "And at the heart of that effort must be dedicated professionals like Chris Stevens and his colleagues, who put their lives on the line for a country—our country—because they believed – as I do – that America is the greatest force for peace and progress the world has ever known\n",

      "We need to put sustained pressure on the government in Baghdad to get its political house in order, move forward with national reconciliation, and finally stand up a national guard\n",
      "On the Syrian side, the big obstacle to getting more ground forces to engage ISIS, beyond the Syrian Kurds who are already deep in the fight, is that the viable Sunni opposition groups remain understandably preoccupied with fighting Assad who, let us remember, has killed many more Syrians than the terrorists have\n",
      "So we need to move simultaneously toward a political solution to the civil war that paves the way for a new government with new leadership, and to encourage more Syrians to take on ISIS as well\n",
      "It would also give us new leverage in the diplomatic process that Secretary Kerry is pursuing\n",
      "And Russia and Iran have to face the fact that continuing to prop up a vicious dictator will not bring stability\n",
      "Now, to be clear, though, there is an important role for Russia to help in resolving the conflict in Syria\n",
      "And we must get them to carry their share of the burden, with military intelligence and financial contributions, as well as using their influence with fighters and tribes in Iraq and Syria\n",
      "Countries like Jordan have offered more, and we should take them up on it, because ultimately our efforts will only succeed if the Arabs and Turks step up in a much bigger way\n",
      "So far, however, Turkey has been more focused on the Kurds than on countering ISIS\n",
      "At the moment, they're focused in other areas because of their concerns in the region, especially the threat from Iran\n",
      "Now, we should have no illusions about how difficult the mission before us really is\n",
      "But if we press forward on both sides of the border, in the air and on the ground, as well as diplomatically, I do believe we can crush ISIS's enclave of terror\n",

      "ISIS is working hard to extend its reach, establish affiliates and cells far from its home base, and despite the significant setbacks it has encountered, not just with ISIS and its ambitious plans, but even Al Qaida, including the death of Osama bin Laden, they are still posing great threats to so many\n",

      "When it comes to blocking terrorist recruitment, we have to identify the hotspots, the specific neighborhoods and villages, the prisons and schools where recruitment happens in clusters, like the neighborhood in Brussels where the Paris attacks were planned\n",
      "Through partnerships with local law enforcement and civil society, especially with Muslim community leaders, we have to work to tip the balance away from extremism in these hotspots\n",

      "But we still can't close our eyes to the fact that there is a distorted and dangerous stream of extremism within the Muslim world that continues to spread\n",
      "Its adherents are relatively few in number, but capable of causing profound damage, most especially to their own communities throughout an arc of instability that stretches from North and West Africa to Asia\n",
      "As we do this, we must be building up a global counterterrorism infrastructure that is more active and adaptable than the terror networks we're trying to defeat\n",
      "So, we created the Global Counterterrorism Forum, which now brings together nearly 30 countries, many from the Muslim world\n",
      "It should be a clearing house for directing assistance to countries that need it, for mobilizing common action against threats\n",
      "At the end of the day, we still must be prepared to go after terrorists wherever they plot using all the tools at our disposal, that includes targeted strikes by U\n",
      "All of this—stopping foreign fighters, blocking terrorist financing, doing battle in cyberspace—is vital to the war against ISIS, but it also lays the foundation for defusing and defeating the next threat and the one after that\n",
      "After 9/11, the United States made a lot of progress breaking down bureaucratic barriers to allow for more and better information sharing among agencies responsible for keeping us safe\n",
      "Today, European nations don't even always alert each other when they turn away a suspected jihadist at the border, or when a passport is stolen\n",
      "I appreciate how hard this is, especially given the sheer number of suspects and threats, but this has to change\n",
      "The United States must work with Europe to dramatically and immediately improve intelligence sharing and counterterrorism coordination\n",
      "Law enforcement also needs the trust of residents and communities, including in our own country Muslim Americans\n",
      "Muslim Americans are working every day on the front lines of the fight against radicalization\n",
      "We should take the concerns of law enforcement and counterterrorism professionals seriously\n",
      "On the other hand, we know there are legitimate concerns about government intrusion, network security, and creating new vulnerabilities that bad actors can and would exploit\n",
      "We need to challenge our best minds in the private sector to work with our best minds in the public sector to develop solutions that will both keep us safe and protect our privacy\n",
      "Our highest priority, of course, must always be protecting the American people\n",
      "And we should be taking a close look at the safeguards in the visa programs as well, but we cannot allow terrorists to intimidate us into abandoning our values and our humanitarian obligations\n",
      "Turning away orphans, applying a religious test, discriminating against Muslims, slamming the door on every Syrian refugee, that is just not who we are\n",
      "And remember, many of these refugees are fleeing the same terrorists who threaten us\n",
      "The entire world must be part of this fight, but we must lead it\n",
      "I know how hard this is because we've done it before\n",
      "To impose the toughest sanctions in history on Iran, to stop a dictator from slaughtering his people in Libya, to support a fledgling democracy in Afghanistan, we have to use every pillar of American power—military and diplomacy, development and economic and cultural influence, technology and maybe most importantly our values\n",

      "What we have done with airstrikes has made a difference, but now it needs to make a greater difference and we need more of a coalition, you know, flying those missions with us\n",
      "And we need—one thing that I believe we haven't done yet is make it clear to Baghdad that we are going to be arming Sunni tribes and Kurds if they don't, because at some point, they have to be in the fight\n",
      "Look, I don't think it's useful to go back in and replow old ground\n",
      "I think that, from the perspective of what they had accomplished at that time, even though they had seized and held territory, the major focus of our government was on trying to remove Assad from power, so that there could be a resolution, a political resolution\n",
      "Now that ISIS has made clear that I think in part because they have been pushed hard by the airstrikes, by the Kurds, they're now expanding their reach so that they can keep their propaganda going\n",
      "But even when I was still there, which is publicly known, I thought we needed to do more earlier to try to identify indigenous Syrian fighters, so-called \\moderates\\—and I do think there were some early on—that we could have done more to help them in their fight against Assad\n",
      "But if you look at where we are right now, we have to try to clear the air of the bombing attacks that are still being carried out to a limited extent by the Syrian military, now supplemented by the Russian air force\n",
      "And it proved to be successful, not easy—it never is—but I think now is the time for us to revisit those plans\n",
      "I also believe, as I said in the speech, that if we begin the conversation about a no-fly zone, something that, you know, Turkey discussed with me back when I was secretary of state in 2012, it will confront a lot of our partners in the region and beyond about what they're going to do\n",
      "And it can give us leverage in the discussions that Secretary Kerry is carrying on right now\n",
      "We had the UAE, Qatar, Jordan involved in what we were doing on the ground, and it takes constant outreach and, obviously, you have to define the problem in a way that they see it as affecting their national interests\n",
      "If you allow Syria to fall into as terrible a distress as it currently is and basically Assad being a proxy for, a frontman for the Iranians, the Russians are interested in their naval base\n",
      "Well, he has a very short-term view of history, because it is not at all clear what the final outcome will be in the places that you named\n",
      "As I mentioned in the speech, I spoke about the foundations of the region sinking into the sand just as the Arab Spring was breaking\n",
      "And I did so not knowing about the Arab Spring coming to full bloom, but because it was so clear that what was being done by dictatorships, by the denial of opportunity, by the repression, by the sectarian divide just could not stand\n",
      "They have not been able to figure out how to prevent the disruptions that they are confronted with because of internal divides and because of some of the external pressures that are coming from terrorist groups and others\n",
      "Now, deposing Milosevic left problems, but problems that we came at by having a deal—in fact, my husband's in Dayton today speaking about the Dayton Accord where people who had been slaughtering each other had to come together and resolve to exist within a government together\n",
      "Well, I just don't think we should have religious tests about who we bring as refugees into our country\n",
      "Which is, again, why I said in the speech that Congress should be providing resources for us to do it right, you know, not trying to stop it\n",
      "I just don't believe that's in keeping with our values or our history, and frankly it doesn't send the kind of message that we want to send to the rest of the world\n",
      "The other side of the coin, though, is we have been doing so little—because of Republican opposition, mostly, to better train and prepare people who have been, really, either sidelined or whacked up in—against their head by globalization\n",
      "And I see those two things as going together because we have to first and foremost focus on how we better prepare more Americans to be competitive in the global economy, and I don't think we've done that\n",
      "So looking for a way to begin the discussions about the negotiations that lead to the coalition as quickly as possible\n",
      "It wasn't something that just happened overnight\n",
      "Well, back in the first term when Leon Panetta and Dave Petraeus and I made our recommendation about vetting and arming Syrian moderate rebels, the target was Assad, it was to defend themselves and be able to prevent the military taking over territory and creating the kind of humanitarian disaster that obviously we've all seen\n",
      "Since then, I know it's been a very difficult task for the—our government to take on and pursue successfully, but one of the challenges has been trying to draw lines, and you draw lines because you want to be able to vet and follow what happens to the arms that you are equipping people with\n",
      "But you can't really take Syrians who are rebelling against Assad, and tell them they can't use their training and their weapons against the person who, as I said my speech, has killed far more Syrians than ISIS has to date\n",
      "And that's why I focused on ISIS\n",
      "I mean, because I think it's—I think right now, we have one overriding goal\n",
      "As I outlined, we need to crush their territorial domain, and we need to try to secure the entire border between Syria and Turkey\n",
      "That can only happen to the political process, so our efforts should be focused on ISIS, and yes, there are other terrorist groups, al-Nusra, whom you mentioned, is that particularly lethal fighter\n",
      "But right now, we've got the Russians in protecting Assad, the Iranians and Hezbollah protecting Assad\n",
      "We need to get people to turn against the common enemy of ISIS, and then we need to figure out how we put together a political outcome that provides enough autonomy, so that the separate communities within Syria will be able to re-create a Syrian state, even though it probably is unlikely it will be controlled by the Alawites from Damascus the same way it was before the civil war started\n",
      "Look, as I said, we should be sending more special operators, we should be empowering our trainers in Iraq, we should be, you know, leading an air coalition, using both fighter planes and drones\n",
      "And I would certainly expect to and hope to work with the Russians to be able to do that\n",
      "You know, the Russians have, as you know, then I primarily focused on Assad's enemies and not on ISIS\n",
      "After Hollande comes here, he's going to go to Moscow to see Putin, and I—and as I said earlier, I think getting Russia to play a role in that and getting Assad to understand that what happens to him will be a result of a political resolution, which Secretary Kerry is undertaking right now, but to have a swath of territory that could be a safe zone both for Syrians so they wouldn't have to leave but also for humanitarian relief\n",
      "And I think that it would give us this extra leverage that I'm looking for in the diplomatic pursuits with Russia with respect to the political outcome in Syria\n",
      "Well, I think that that the Saudis are critical to achieving the goals, and, you know, the Saudis are now engaged in the discussions that Secretary Kerry is leading, they're in the same process as the Iranians, which is something that was hard to get to but finally achieved\n",
      "It's understandable, but the Saudis need to have a broader view, and looking at Iran's influence inside Syria, their growing influence in Iraq as well as in Yemen, they need to understand they have to help us stabilize at least Northern Syria to start with, while trying to come up with some resolution of the Civil War\n",
      "She talked about her plans to fight ISIS and remove Syria's Bashar al-Assad, the challenges of dealing with Russia, with China and with the problem of climate change and this—the role of the United States in a rapidly changing world\n",
      "From a balcony overlooking the White House, she told me how she hoped fix the dysfunction in Washington and what being president is all about\n",
      "Right no because— He got a lot done, too, despite\n",
      "You know, when I was first lady, when I was a senator and when I was secretary of state, I worked across the aisle all the time and sometimes there was only one thing that I could find to work with somebody on because everything else we were at odds over\n",
      "They set up the separation of powers— And they made it really difficult to get things done, and some years it's really hard, and we're in one of these periods where we have a minority within the other party that doesn't believe in compromise, doesn't believe in reaching consensus— No, no\n",
      "No—because part of what you have to do is make it clear to everyone else who is in that party that there is room for negotiation\n",
      "And those who do not even believe in the legislative process because they think that they arrived with all the answers and there is nothing that they can learn, maybe there is some ground\n",
      "I worked with Tom DeLay for heaven's sakes on reforming the adoption and foster care system because even though he and I were politically opposites, he cared a lot about foster kids and he and his wife had taken them in\n",
      "That is just a 24/7 effort and I will put whatever it takes into doing it\n",
      "Sometimes just 30, 60 seconds people will look into your eyes and they'll say, \\I need help\\, you know\n",
      "Maybe there is just something she can do to contribute to the life that will be better for somebody else\n",
      "I say in my speeches, and I know it sometimes sounds a little corny, I say, you know, you don't expect the presidential candidate to say we need more love and kindness in America, but I'm saying it because I believe it\n",
      "and specifically with respect to ISIS I think it has really accelerated a discussion about thousand world is going to deal with not only ISIS—how to deny it territory—but also with the whole network radical Jihadism which has taken advantage of that arc of instability from North Africa to South Asia\n",
      "And so I think it's really pushed all of these discussions that you have in the situation room, that you have in lots of places; but now it's pushed into the open and it's a matter of personal and political debate\n",
      "Council on Foreign Relations because I think it's important that we look at it from a broader perspective\n",
      "Number one, we have to deny them territory with a multi-pronged, multi-national effort, and the United States must lead that effort\n",
      "That's General Petraeus whom you recently talked with and was very straightforward and said, \\Look, we basically paid the tribal sheiks in Anbar\\ and now we would probably continue that across the border into Syria to pull together a fighting force, and it works\n",
      "And it worked, in part, because of revulsion against the predecessor, al Qaeda in Iraq, the treatment of everybody at their hands, but it also worked because they were promised that they would have the autonomy and authority to make a lot of decisions within Iraq on their own behalf\n",
      "And now you've got the Sunni sheiks, the fighters on the sidelines or, even worse, some of them making common cause with ISIS\n",
      "He would not give us what's called a status of forces agreement that would provide the protections for American troops that we have to expect anywhere in the world\n",
      "And the prior administration, the Bush administration had set a date certain for us to withdraw\n",
      "That is our highest and best use\n",
      "We also need to get those Special Forces that the President has authorized into the arena as soon as possible because they will be able to tell us what more is needed\n",
      "We have over 3,000 American troops in Iraq trying to do just that, working to essentially undo the damage that Maliki did to the army, try to return it to what it was when American troops left\n",
      "Now it seems to me there are people both currently serving and retired like General Petraeus who know a lot of the players\n",
      "And we should be utilizing anyone who has that kind of personal contact because it's all relationship based\n",
      "We need people to go over there and look into the eyes of some of those tribal sheiks who will say you betrayed us, and we'll say, no, we didn't\n",
      "You stood against al Qaeda in Iraq because you saw the damage they were doing to your way of life, to your people—the oppressive, violent approach that they took\n",
      "But with respect to Russia, I am not yet sure what exactly Putin's objectives are\n",
      "We have to operate on two tracks at one time in a lot of what we're doing, as I just was saying in another regard\n",
      "When it comes to Russia, they have to understand that we are going to go forward with our multi-national, multi-pronged approach\n",
      "It's going to require the Russians to be at least respectful of our efforts\n",
      "You know it's not—you can make a mistake, but they got so close that a mistake was possible or they just didn't care\n",
      "Now, I think they have been pushed back, and I think that we'll be able to have a more realistic conversation with them, which I would urge\n",
      "Because here's what also what has to happen—another one of these dual tracks there, Charlie\n",
      "—in Vienna and everywhere and there has to be more willingness on the part of Russia and Iran to take a hard look at how we prioritize\n",
      "You're going to continue to see Russia from the air, Iran from the ground where Iranian soldiers are dying on behalf of Assad\n",
      "You're going to see them continue to try to hold the territory they have and push back against the opposition\n",
      "So part of what we have to do is say, look, you've got to help us get to a political and diplomatic solution and you've got to either get out of the way or come on board with respect to ISIS, and we have to be very clear about that\n",
      "Now, knowing the Russians and the Iranians who have a lot invested in Assad, this is a long process\n",
      "But if they will in their own mind, say quit bombing the people who are helping us fight ISIS, go ahead and put a cordon around the area that Assad still controls, protect him there while we do the diplomatic and political work\n",
      "Charlie—that would not happen because we're going to put up a no-fly zone where the Russians are clearly kept informed\n",
      "If we can stop hundreds of thousands of more Syrians leaving Syria because they get to a place where they can get medical aid and food and the like, that's good for Russia\n",
      "Why does Russia want this incredible burden that is going to be coming up through Europe and, yes, maybe they are happy to see Europe suffering like this but, in the end, it makes no sense for them and makes no sense for all of us\n",
      "Look, it's never easy with the Russians and particularly hard with Putin, but if you say, as I think you should and as I think the conversation needs to get to an operational level\n",
      "You will know very well where it is because it's going to be the same people who are working now to de-conflict airspace— The same Americans you're dealing with on a mill to mill level but we have got to figure out how to keep more Syrians in Syria and frankly it's good for the fight against ISIS if we've got population that then can be a locus for that\n",
      "Well, at this point, I cannot conceive of any circumstances where I would agree to do that because I think the best way to defeat ISIS is, as I've said, from the air which we lead; on the ground which we enable, empower, train, equip; and in cyberspace where, don't forget, they are a formidable adversary online\n",
      "So what I want to say is, look, we don't know yet how many Special Forces might be needed, how many trainers and surveillance and enablers might be needed, but in terms of thousands of combat troops like some on the Republican side are recommending, I think that should be a non-starter\n",
      "And it should be a non-starter both because I don't think it's the smartest way to go after ISIS\n",
      "Yes, let me address that because it's a totally fair question\n",
      "I think one of the ways we need to approach this is continue the discussions about national unity but, as a pre-condition, say we need to join together right now before they get a stronghold and work to eliminate ISIS in Sirte, and it is something that is going to require a lot of cooperation\n",
      "They need to form even a loose confederation to try to push ISIS literally into the sea before they get a stronghold\n",
      "There are a lot of other bad actors, don't get me wrong, bad actors who have taken up— Again, I think it's dangerous to make these sweeping generalizations\n",
      "They're the big exception because they're a relatively small country and they've worked really hard to get everybody under a tent, so to speak, and get them organized\n",
      "Libya has pockets of functioning government, but they are not united, and it may well be very difficult to unite them because there has been historical rivalry between them\n",
      "And I do think if we could turn the clock back, if there had been a way, and we tried, to convince the Libyans to take more help, not just from Americans but from Europeans with whom they had preexisting relationships or even others that might have come to support them—the Scandinavians, for example—help them do more\n",
      "They were even resistant to having foreigners come and help them figure out how better to run their oil industry\n",
      "Well, then we should get about the business of leading\n",
      "I remember in some of the arguments I had in the White House over Mubarak\n",
      "I was one of the skeptics, right, because what was going to replace him\n",
      "And I remember saying, you know, this may look great in 25 years, but between now and then, there is a lot of trouble for the Egyptians, the region and us\n",
      "And I think, look, when I became Secretary of State, Osama bin laden was alive and with his lieutenants plotting against us\n",
      "We had hundreds of thousands of American troops in the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan and our alliances were incredibly frayed, Charlie\n",
      "We can't just focus on ISIS\n",
      "Not maybe started by us but in which we might very well have— No but—it wasn't meant to\n",
      "And I've been saying this—again, I gave a big speech about what I will do as president and to deal with enforcing the agreement, because there are a lot of important details, and the Iranians have to know right from the beginning that they will pay a price, that there will be consequences for any misbehavior or breaches\n",
      "No, but this is a big deal because what the nuclear program literally under lid, so to speak— Now, it's not so, you know, important that we stay as focused\n",
      "We have to enforce the agreement but we're not spending all our time and effort dealing with their nuclear program which they really got under fast track when Bush was president and we had to deal with it\n",
      "I had to convince the Russians and the Chinese\n",
      "They understood that the agreement was better than they thought it would be, so they, too, can turn their attention to the rest of this bad behavior because what our big fear was, not only that we'd get a war over trying to prevent Iran from going forward with this program even if it was only two or three years, but that we would see a wicked race to proliferation in the Gulf\n",
      "I think given the hand he was dealt by this congress and the difficulty in trying to come up with a credible plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in our own country, he has played that hand very well\n",
      "And it drives you crazy because you keep saying to yourself, if these people would only stop this, they could build economies, they could have so much to contribute to the world\n",
      "And it is a great shame to the entire human race, but particularly to the advanced economies such as ours, that we haven't made common cause to try to reverse or at least stabilize the temperature increase\n",
      "You know, when President Obama and I crashed into their meeting in '09 in Copenhagen, they were not happy to see us\n",
      "Now they've come with I think a 900-page report and they've said look, we have a lot of work to do, because they can't breathe the air, their water is polluted\n",
      "So when it came out, you know, none of us saw the details until it was actually produced some few months ago\n",
      "But there is another point I just want to quickly make which is, you know, the Republicans are always for every trade agreement\n",
      "Trade if it's going to be successful for the American worker, the American business, has to be more than just special deals for giant multi-national corporations who have some linkage to America\n",
      "So, for me, the trade agreement on the merits is not one I can support and the failure to kind of make the other side of the equation fair so that more Americans will get the skills they need to be able to compete, you know, just makes it a decision that I'm not ready to take now\n",
      "It was hard because we had a lot of back and forth, but we came out with a bill, we got it done\n",
      "And so, they don't want to use user fees\n",
      "We have a failing grade or maybe at the most a D-minus— Well, and costing the money\n",
      "We have a lot of bridges that if you had a choice you wouldn't cross because they're not in good shape\n",
      "I mean it is—the tax system truly is stacked for those on the top, and it is something that breeds so much resentment and grievance on the part of small businesses, on the part of hard-working people and, you know, the wealthy pay too little and middle class people pay too much and we've got to get a better balance\n",
      "I just want to start with the people who actually can contribute more and make the tax system fair in the process\n",
      "We're going to have to take a hard look at it because right now we have a very high rate but the effective rate hardly ever reaches that\n",
      "I don't want to stifle American business, but I want to change the incentives\n",
      "I'll tell you just a very quick story\n",
      "I actually called up someone we both know to say, seriously\n",
      "Now, we must change those incentives\n",
      "No because, you know, President Obama suspended it, nobody even noticed because we have to fund social security\n",
      "—I mean the rest of Europe is annoyed, the United States is annoyed, but I don't think inversions should be legal and I know that the Justice Department and Treasury Department have looked at those\n",
      "And obviously, as time went by, it employed fewer people but it's always been an American flagship company\n",
      "And for them to say, you know, this is just really a game—because if you listen to it, you know, how many executives are actually going to move to Dublin\n",
      "Bush\n",
      "We repatriated, they said the same thing to us\n",
      "—and they put more money into CEO pay and bonus\n",
      "Bush is on record as saying he would never have supported at the end because they all lied us to\n",
      "So if we're going to do a repatriation, it's going to have to be rock solid and very clear about where that money goes and what it's used for\n",
      "I don't want to preside over an exodus of American companies\n",
      "So I want to be a good president for business, but I also want to be a good president for everybody in America, not just for, you know, CEOs and activist shareholders\n",
      "I mean look— Well, all I know is that it was in 2007 that I called out Wall Street on the use of securities to, you know, play the mortgage market and called them out on the hedge fund loophole for carried interest\n",
      "And these guys know me and they, you know— It's ludicrous\n",
      "I mean it's ludicrous\n",
      "I mean there's no there, there but the fact is I saw a lot of people when I was secretary of state and I worked really hard to increase exports from American businesses\n",
      "I saw a lot of business people, I saw a lot of union leaders\n",
      "Or Corning, a company that I knew well from my time in the senate—they're trying to put a tariff on us that is going to drive us out of business\n",
      "You know, I worked really hard to get more jobs for Americans, and that meant representing big business and small business and everybody in between\n",
      "So there is a lot at stake in this election and, you know, the Republicans are certainly spurring me on because of what they say and how they say it and their values which are so negative and really mean-spirited in lots of ways\n",
      "It was marvelous\n",
      "Number two, do everything we can to dismantle this very effective virtual jihadist network that they are using on the Internet\n",
      "And number three, do whatever is necessary to protect us here at home\n",
      "Radical elements who use a dangerous and distorted view of Islam to promote their jihadist ambitions, I'm fine with that\n",
      "No, because, look, that—you know enough about religion, you've studied it\n",
      "I don't want to do that because, number one, it doesn't do justice to the vast numbers of Muslims in our own country and around the world who are peaceful people\n",
      "Number two, it helps to create this clash of civilizations that is actually a recruiting tool for ISIS and other radical jihadists who use this as a way of saying we're in a war against the West\n",
      "You must join us\n",
      "If you are a Muslim, you must join us\n",
      "If you're a law-abiding, peace-loving Muslim, you need to be with us against those who are distorting Islam\n",
      "They cannot permit the recruitment and the actual direction of attacks or the celebration of violence by this sophisticated Internet user\n",
      "They're going to have to help us take down these announcements and these appeals——they get up\n",
      "I have to believe that the best minds in the private sector, in the public sector could come together to help us deal with this evolving threat\n",
      "And you know, I know what the argument is from our friends in the industry\n",
      "Clearly we have to have a much more robust air campaign against ISIS targets, against the oil infrastructure, against their leadership\n",
      "And that was one of my biggest complaints about Maliki, because what he did was to basically not only destroy the military because of his sectarianism but also he went after those Sunni leaders in Anbar and we know from reporting that some of them are supportive of ISIS, some of the former Ba'ath military officers under Saddam Hussein\n",
      "The law enforcement, FBI have come to that conclusion\n",
      "We have to up our game against terrorists abroad and at home and we have to take account of the fact that our gun laws and the easy access to those guns by people who shouldn't get them, mentally ill people, fugitives, felons and the Congress continuing to refuse to prohibit people on the no-fly list from getting guns, which include a lot of domestic and international terrorists, these are two parts of the same approach that I'm taking to make us safe\n",
      "You get on the list because there is some credible evidence you belong on the list\n",
      "Now obviously, that— —some mistakes, of course\n",
      "So I'm not—I can't take anybody seriously who's going to begin to chip away at the no-fly list\n",
      "He said, that way, we can take out the Muslims\n",
      "With respect to the gun issue, it' s legal to buy guns in America if you are eligible to buy a gun, you can go buy a gun and hundreds of thousands of people apparently are in the aftermath of what happened in San Bernardino\n",
      "I just want people to understand some of the threats we now face, whether it's the guy in Charleston, who should have never have been given a gun but the universal background check was not fast enough, didn't find the fact he was prohibited, went into the church and killed nine innocent people, we should be able to approach both of these with some sense of, you know, unity about how we prevent terrorist attacks and how we prevent the wrong people from getting a hold of guns\n",
      "Well, I just respectfully disagree\n",
      "But I think it's a little bit amusing that the Republican National Committee would go after me, since all of their candidates and their party philosophy is massive spending cuts and massive tax decreases for those at the very top with no thought to how to pay for it or the trillions of dollars it would add to the national debt, you know\n",
      "And when my husband ended, we had a balanced budget and a surplus\n",
      "I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for digging us out\n",
      "It's something my husband certainly tried to achieve, because I want Americans to know that I get it, that a lot of the losses that they experienced because of the great recession are still really pulling them down\n",
      "You know, I have an infrastructure plan that's on top of what the congress just passed\n",
      "And I'm also really going to defend the Middle Class, because a lot of these proposals would have a very bad effect\n",
      "Well, you know, obviously I don't like hearing that, George\n",
      "And I believe the American people who are looking for somebody who is a fighter, who will stand up there, just as I did, tell you what I will do, tell you I will do everything to make it happen\n",
      "Well, because number one the kind of plan that was passed in the Affordable Care Act gives you a market-based way of getting into the insurance market\n",
      "That's why it's important we continue to support community health centers, we continue to support our hospitals because those are often the places that undocumented people and poor people go\n",
      "Because I don't think legally you can\n",
      "Oh, goodness gracious\n",
      "I don't know, because he's a—he's a reality TV star\n",
      "I mean tens of millions of people have watched him for more than a decade on TV and he is part of the celebrity and he will stay whatever he wants to say and if he's held account, that—it's not true, he just brushes it off and he goes on\n",
      "You know, I've said for a long time, George, that I try—I try to take criticism seriously but not personally\n",
      "And by that I mean, look, if somebody says, hey, you know, you didn't do—or she didn't do a good job answering this or, you know, I don't think that that, you know, adds up, whatever they might say, I will take that seriously\n",
      "Just, you know, one of those statements of fact that deserves a response\n",
      "His support in this campaign means a great deal to me personally, because I admire so much his service to our country\n",
      "He is a great Minnesotan and a great American, and we're so privileged to have him with us today\n",
      "I also had the great privilege of working with him when he was on the National Security Council during my husband's administration\n",
      "You know, he brings a mix of expertise and empathy that has been conspicuously missing from much of our public debate\n",
      "And I am grateful he is here today, but I'm also a little jealous that all of you here at the university get to have the benefit of his experience\n",
      "We can't let it stop us from doing what is right and necessary to make us safe, and doing it in way that is consistent with our values\n",
      "We cannot let fear push us into reckless actions that end up making us less safe\n",
      "Sadly, in America in 2015, turning on the news and hearing about a mass shooting is not unusual\n",
      "But this one turned out to be different, because these killers were a husband and wife inspired by ISIS\n",
      "It made us all feel it could have been anywhere, at any time\n",
      "And now we are all grappling with what all this means for our future, for our safety, our sense of well-being, and our trust and connections with our neighbors\n",
      "Just yesterday, a man in Maryland was charged with receiving thousands of dollars from ISIS for use in planning an attack\n",
      "But in the Twin Cities, you have also seen firsthand how communities come together to resist radicalization: local imams condemning terrorist violence, local artists and activists pushing back against terrorist propaganda\n",
      "I just met with a group of community leaders who told me about some of the work and the challenges that they are dealing with\n",
      "Throughout our history, we've stared into the face of evil and refused to blink\n",
      "We beat Fascism, won the Cold War, brought Osama bin Laden to justice\n",
      "And we will defeat these new enemies, just as we've defeated those who've threatened us in the past\n",
      "Because it is not enough to contain ISIS, we must defeat ISIS, break its momentum and then its back\n",
      "And not just ISIS, but the broader radical jihadist movement that also includes al Qaeda and offshoots like al Shabaab in Somalia\n",
      "Now, waging and winning this fight will require serious leadership\n",
      "But unfortunately, our political debate has been anything but serious\n",
      "That's exactly what ISIS wants from us\n",
      "Bluster and bigotry are not credentials for becoming Commander-in-Chief\n",
      "And it is hard to take seriously senators who talk tough but then hold up key national security nominations, including the top official at the Treasury Department responsible for disrupting terrorist financing\n",
      "So, yes, we need a serious discussion\n",
      "So we need to pursue all of them at once, using every pillar of American power\n",
      "What it will not require is tens of thousands of American combat troops\n",
      "That is not the right action for us to take in this situation\n",
      "So there is a lot to do, and today, I want to focus on the third part of my plan, how we defend our country and prevent radicalization here at home\n",
      "And fifth, empower our Muslim-American communities, who are on the front-lines of the fight against radicalization\n",
      "But that's just some of what we have to do\n",
      "Experts from the FBI, the intelligence community, Homeland Security, DOD, the State Department, and the technology industry should work together to develop a unified national strategy to defeat ISIS in cyberspace, using all of our capabilities to deny jihadists virtual territory, just as we work to deny them actual territory\n",
      "It's imperative that the Saudis, the Qataris, the Kuwaitis and others stop their citizens from supporting radical schools, madrassas and mosques around the world, once and for all, and that should be the top priority in all of our discussions with these countries\n",
      "Right now, European nations don't always alert each other when they turn away a suspected extremist at the border or when a passport is stolen\n",
      "Except for limited exceptions like diplomats and aid workers, anyone who has traveled in the past five years to a country facing serious problems with terrorism and foreign fighters should have to go through a full visa investigation, no matter where they're from\n",
      "Rigorous vetting already takes place while these refugees are still overseas, and it's a process that historically takes 18 to 24 months\n",
      "And just as important, we cannot allow terrorists to intimidate us into abandoning our values and our humanitarian obligations\n",
      "Turning away orphans, applying a religious test that discriminates against Muslims, slamming the door on every single Syrian refugee; that is not who we are\n",
      "So after rigorous screening, we should welcome families fleeing Syria just as the Twin Cities and this state have welcomed previous generations of refugees, exiles, and immigrants\n",
      "And I think we must\n",
      "President Obama recently signed the USA Freedom Act, which was passed by a bipartisan majority in Congress\n",
      "It protects civil liberties while maintaining capabilities that our intelligence and law enforcement agencies need to keep us safe\n",
      "But we can't just throw up our hands\n",
      "The tech community and the government have to stop seeing each other as adversaries and start working together to keep us safe from terrorists\n",
      "It defies common sense that Republicans in Congress refuse to make it harder for potential terrorists to buy guns\n",
      "If you're too dangerous to fly, you're too dangerous to buy a gun, period\n",
      "Well, I have news for them, terrorists use guns to kill Americans\n",
      "You see, I have this old fashioned idea that we elect a President in part, in large part, to keep us safe, from terrorists, from gun violence, from whatever threatens our families and communities\n",
      "And I'm not going to let the gun lobby or anyone else tell me that's not the right path for us to go down\n",
      "And not just in the immediate wake of an attack\n",
      "It's disgraceful that Congress has thus far failed to keep faith with first responders suffering from the lasting health effects of 9/11\n",
      "We have to make sure that local law enforcement has the resources and training they need to keep us safe\n",
      "And they should be more closely synced up with national counterterrorism experts, including with better use of \\fusion centers\\ that serve as clearinghouses for intelligence and coordination\n",
      "And it's important for us to recognize that when we talk about law enforcement, we have made progress in being sure that our federal authorities share information with our state and local authorities, but that was an issue I tackled after 9/11, and we have to stay really vigilant so that information is in the hands where it needs to be\n",
      "Finally, the fifth element in the strategy is empowering Muslim-American communities who are on the front-lines of the fight against radicalization\n",
      "There are millions of peace-loving Muslims living, working, raising families, and paying taxes in our country\n",
      "They are the most likely to recognize the insidious effects of radicalization before it's too late, intervene to help set a young person straight\n",
      "That's why law enforcement has worked so hard since 9/11 to build up trust and strong relationships within Muslim-American communities\n",
      "Here in the Twin Cities, you have an innovative partnership that brings together parents, teachers, imams, and others in the Somali-American community with law enforcement, non-profits, local businesses, mental health professionals and others to intervene with young people who are at risk\n",
      "Now I know that like many places across the country, there's more work to do to increase trust between communities and law enforcement\n",
      "Just last month, I know here a young African American man was fatally shot by a police officer\n",
      "Whatever the outcome, tragedies like this raise hard questions about racial justice in America and put at risk efforts to build the community relationships that help keep us safe from crime and from terrorism\n",
      "When people see that respect and trust are two-way streets, they're more likely to work hand-in-hand with law enforcement\n",
      "\\ That's a message we need to hear from leaders within Muslim-American communities across our country\n",
      "But we also want to highlight the successes in Muslim American communities, and there are so many of them\n",
      "I just met with the first Somali-American council member of the City Council here\n",
      "And he was proudly telling me how much change Somali immigrants, now Muslim-Americans have made in parts of the city and neighborhoods that had been pretty much hollowed out\n",
      "And that is one of the many reasons why we must all stand up against offensive, inflammatory, hateful, anti-Muslim rhetoric\n",
      "You know, not only do these comments cut against everything we stand for as Americans, they are also dangerous\n",
      "As the Director of the FBI told Congress recently, anything that erodes trust with Muslim-Americans makes the job of law enforcement more difficult\n",
      "They're not only afraid of being perceived as a threat, they are afraid of being threatened because of who they are\n",
      "This is such a open-hearted and generous community, I hope there will be even more efforts perhaps under the aegis of the university and certainly Governor Dayton and others, to bring people together to reassure members of the community, particularly children and teenagers that they are welcome, invited and valued here in this city and state\n",
      "Now Donald Trump's proposal to ban all Muslims from entering the United States has rightly sparked outrage across our country and around the world\n",
      "But the truth is, many of those same candidates have also said disgraceful things about Muslims\n",
      "I know how hard this is because I've done it\n",
      "And demonizing Muslims also feeds a narrative that jihadists use to recruit new followers around the world, that the United States is at war with Islam\n",
      "It's a clash between civilization and barbarism and that's how it must be seen and fought\n",
      "And it's about the capacity of each generation to honor the creed as old as our founding, E Pluribus Unum\n",
      "It's no coincidence that American Muslims have long been better integrated and less susceptible to radicalization than Muslims in less welcoming countries\n",
      "We must instead rely on the principles written into our American DNA\n",
      "Our country was founded by people fleeing religious persecution\n",
      "\\ So to all our Muslim-American brothers and sisters, this is your country too\n",
      "And I want to remind us, particularly our Republican friends, that George W\n",
      "Bush was right\n",
      "Six days after 9/11 he went to a Muslim community center and here's what he said, those who feel like they can intimidate our fellow citizens to take their anger don't represent the best of America, they represent the worst of human kind, and they should be ashamed of that kind of behavior\n",

      "And it really caused me to think hard about the kind of president I want to be\n",
      "Obviously, I want to be a president who gets the economy moving for everybody and get incomes rising and more good paying jobs\n",
      "And I want to be a president that keeps us safe and secure, and takes on the threat and dangers that we face\n",

      "And after talking to experts, the leading experts in our country—not just in Alzheimer's, but in other neurodegenerative diseases, like Parkinson's, the overwhelming response was, if we invested just $2 billion more a year, we would make tremendous progress\n",
      "And I want to just make a few other quick acknowledgments\n",
      "And to the South Church, thank you for letting us be here today\n",
      "That person will, after being sworn in, and the celebrations that go with an inauguration, go into the White House, go into the oval office, and face the challenges that await\n",
      "Because we have work to do\n",
      "But I need all of you to be part of this campaign, to be part of the first in the nation primary, because in many ways, you are the first—or depending on how you define it, the last line of defense\n",

      "And I know that we are going to make the right decision—not because my name will be on the ballot, but because all of us know what the stakes are, and how high they happen to be\n",
      "As you know, I have had two full town hall meetings just on the issue of substance abuse\n",

      "So I go to the parliament and I speak about democracy and all the rest of it and take some pictures and do some visits afterwards, and I thought boy, we think we have it hard, here she is trying to work with a Congress that includes people who were mortal enemies with one another against her, against others, and she's working so hard to make this democracy what it should be against tremendous odds\n",

      "And very often, we don't have real-time information because we also have to close what's called the Charleston loophole, where the killer in Charleston went to buy a gun\n",
      "Under the loophole, he could come back and get it after three business days\n",
      "The information that he wasn't eligible because he had a felony conviction didn't come through until after he went—used that gun and murdered nine people in a church like this in Charleston\n",
      "And the mental health piece of this is especially troubling, because you don't want to unfairly stigmatize people, but you want to protect the community, so you've got to have information\n",
      "We need to prohibit people who are drastic abusers with restraining orders against them from getting guns\n",
      "I'll work with anybody, but I will also continue to advocate for this, because we are in a whole different era, where these mass shootings, these 33,000 people killed every year, has become a rebuke to us, that we can't figure—figure out how to deal with this\n",

      "A lot of the money that states use to put into colleges and universities has gone into everything from prisons to roads, you name it\n",

      "Because I really do love to call on kids, because that's what this election is actually all about, is their future\n",
      "Because right now, if you are doing a job, and you ask how much somebody else makes, you can be fired or retaliated against\n",
      "And how are we ever gonna know that we get fair pay for—you know, not just women, although that's the biggest discrepancy, but particularly people who are in—you know, positions where it's hard to ask for more, because of their—you know, their working conditions\n",
      "I had a young man here in New Hampshire tell me the reason he was supporting me is because I was in favor of equal pay\n",
      "And when I asked him why, he said because he got his first grown-up adult job when he was 17, and he went to work in the same store where his mother had worked—that's how he got the job—and, his first pay period, brought his paycheck home, he showed his mother, and he watched her face fall\n",
      "This is a big interview for us\n",
      "Well, it's deeply distressing to me because I, as you know, well remember what happened after 9/11\n",
      "And I have publicly given President Bush a lot of credit for the way that he set the tone and his entire administration echoed that\n",
      "But in order to do that, we need to work within our own country with Muslim Americans, so that what I'm hearing from the other side, is not only offensive and shameful, it's dangerous, counterproductive\n",
      "And we need to go after the arc of instability that fuels this terrorist ideology from North Africa to Pakistan, Afghanistan, and go after their funding and their foreign fighters and their very effective use of the Internet\n",
      "And I know you just got back from Israel\n",
      "And we need to do it in alliance with Muslims here in America and elsewhere\n",
      "And when I hear what's coming from the other side—and it's not just one person\n",
      "And it's very troubling to me to try to divide and conquer, divide and conquer, and you know, a house divided against itself cannot stand\n",
      "And we should not reward people who use inflammatory rhetoric, who use the kind of derogatory comments, whether it's about Muslims or Mexicans or women or people with disabilities, whoever it might be\n",
      "Well, I think it's important to be focused on what we can do together, and that's why I do support comprehensive background checks and to close the gun show loophole and the on-line loophole and what's called the Charleston loophole\n",
      "Just today at Osage—you were here when I was speaking to the crowd—and then afterwards, I always take time so people can come up to me\n",
      "And please talk to your friends because what we are proposing is consistent with constitutional rights\n",
      "But it is so important, when we lose 90 people a day, 33,000 Americans every year, and when you have met as many victims of gun violence as I have, when you've sat there and you've listened to their stories about losing a child, losing a husband, losing a parent—and I've met with the mothers who have lost children to gun violence by police hands, by, you know, more likely, gun and gang—deadly combination\n",
      "I've just so many people, from Columbine to Sandy Hook\n",
      "I just can't remain silent\n",
      "We haven't had a single caucus\n",
      "I'm just going to keep working really hard, like right out there today, you know, getting people to caucus for me, connecting them up with my great organizers\n",
      "and we're just going to work as hard as we can to make my case\n",
      "Well, I just\n",
      "Well, you know, that's a great question because I\n",
      "And I'll tell you what changed my mind, and it was maybe something that other women can relate to because I was in the news, like, Would she or wouldn't she, and I kept saying, I'm not going to\n",
      "in politics, in business, and I'm being asked to compete\n",
      "I'm happy to say, you know, my husband this, or candidate X or Y, but to stand up there and be the person out there\n",
      "And I think because, you know, we're coming into our own as women in all walks of life, but still, there's something a little bit daunting about\n",
      "And women and men have to meet those standards because we're talking literally life or death\n",
      "And how much weight you can carry because maybe one of your, you know, fellow soldiers will need that one day\n",
      "But we just had a few women pass Ranger school, which is an enormously\n",
      "It was just less than a handful, but they proved they could do it\n",
      "That's what you want because I think about the job that I'm applying for, and it really is a job interview that I'm doing all over America\n",
      "like a cruise missile or a Predator—armed predator, and recommending to the president that we go with the Navy SEAL option, and then being there that day, watching part of the operation on a video screen in the Situation Room, just holding my breath literally through the whole thing\n",
      "Well, of course you would have to have the Russians to sign off on it\n",
      "But, you know, for the last four years, we have been pushing to try to get a peace conference going\n",
      "Number one, if we could get the Russians on board, because we would have to—and I think we could, if we were to say, look, we need safe zones\n",
      "So, I view myself as being a realist, being practical, and in accordance with our values, because I think it's very important that we get back to promoting our values and pursuing our interests and protecting our security\n",
      "No, because I—because I am always looking for ways that we work together\n",
      "And it used to be easier in the past\n",
      "And, obviously\n",
      "Well, I think that I like it, because I am looking for that common ground somewhere\n",
      "And I don't think that you get it just on the first try\n",
      "I'm not saying it's going to be magic, because part of what's happened—and it is different from when Tip O'Neill and President Reagan were working together—it is so much more gerrymandered\n",
      "I stay pretty focused, as I think we all should, on what we have to do to build on the progress of the Obama administration, but go even further\n",
      "And as the State Department said just this week, that did not happen\n",
      "And it never would have happened, because that's just not the way I treated classified information\n",
      "And, obviously, what I'm asking for is whatever can be transmitted, if it doesn't come through secure, to be transmitted on the unclassified system\n",
      "That's true for every agency in the government and who everybody does business with the government\n",
      "But the important point here is, I had great confidence, because I had worked with Jake Sullivan for years\n",
      "He is the most meticulous, careful person you could possibly do business with\n",
      "Well, I e-mailed two people on their government accounts, because I knew that all of that would be part of the government system\n",
      "So, that's how I conducted the business\n",
      "I was very clear about e-mailing anything having to do with business to people on their government accounts\n",
      "And I think he has been consistently refusing to say that he would vote to repeal this absolute immunity from any kind of responsibility or liability\n",
      "It's the only industry in our country where we have given that kind of carte blanche to do whatever you want to do with no fear of legal consequences\n",
      "Two of us voted against what the NRA says was the most important piece of legislation in 20 years for the gun lobby\n",
      "So, I think that the excuses and efforts by Senator Sanders to avoid responsibility for this vote, which the NRA hailed as the most important in 20 years, points up a clear difference\n",
      "So, I do have a history of taking on what I consider to be the abuses that come from any industry, including Wall Street\n",
      "So, I have plan that will go after not just the big banks, because Dodd-Frank has given us the tools to do a lot of that, but to go after the so-called shadow banking industry\n",
      "That's why I'm so proud to have the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund that I received today in New Hampshire, because I'm going to fight as hard as I can against any efforts to defund Planned Parenthood, something that he supports\n",
      "And I'm going to stand up and make it clear there's a huge difference between us\n",
      "It won't work again, because it is what people are focused on, not for the past, but for the future\n",
      "Secretary Clinton, thanks so much for sitting down with us here in Iowa\n",
      "I'm used to cold weather\n",
      "But I get up every day whether I'm in Iowa, in New Hampshire, wherever I am in the country and I really look forward to the day because I find the opportunity to go out and listen to people, hear their stories, give them my views about what I think the next president should do very energizing and very, you know, reinvigorating all the time\n",
      "A caucus is different from a primary\n",
      "It takes a lot of intensive work to convince people to come out on a cold Monday night, spend a couple of hours in order to stand up for your candidate, but I'm asking Iowans if they'll stand up for me on caucus night\n",
      "I don't feel that it's a good reflection about who will actually come out on caucus night\n",
      "I can only tell you that the energy, the enthusiasm, the excitement of my volunteers, my organizers, the voters who come, who sign up on commit to caucus cards is just building\n",
      "I'm looking at people who are showing up, making up their minds and trying to, you know, convince them to come out and caucus for me\n",
      "Because they are so unpredictable\n",
      "And I think you would have to add a degree of difficulty to polling for a caucus\n",
      "So, I just put that aside\n",
      "I just get up every day like we were saying, going out there, making my case, drawing the contrast because I have the highest regard for my two opponents, but there are real differences\n",
      "Because after the first of the year, a lot more people start paying attention\n",
      "I'm going to do everything I can to win as bigger margin as possible in the caucus and then go to the primary\n",
      "And I have always thought that given the unpredictability and the, you know, changes in people's concerns going into this election, that we wouldn't know exactly how the outcome would be for, you know, a couple of cycles of these primaries and caucuses\n",
      "So, I'm going to do my best to convince more Iowans to come out and caucus for me\n",
      "I went to work to try to make sure that we got health care in the beginning of my husband's administration because of so many people who were left out and were uninsured\n",
      "A lot of the abuses that I thought were there\n",
      "It's not the only thing I talk about because I think you have to view equality of opportunity and how we deliver that in the 21st Century for many different perspectives and that's what I tried to do\n",
      "So, I had a different agenda because I had a different job\n",
      "Going after a lot of the subsidies that, for example, still subsidize the oil and gas industry about $6 billion a year while we have to move toward a clean renewable energy future\n",
      "And he had promised that he would roll out his tax plans before the Iowa caucus on February 1st\n",
      "Because as you saw, I received the Brady campaign endorsement today and both the woman Delfin Cherry who introduced us to the stage and the head of the Brady campaign had lost family members\n",
      "It was really hard standing up there because I have held the hands of and listened to countless people who have lost family members to gun violence\n",
      "And I agree completely with the President about us having to take action now\n",
      "You know, there was a loophole, my opponent voted for it, Senator Sanders, that at the end of three days, business days, you get that gun whether they have finished the background check or not\n",
      "The killer in Charleston who bought that gun, if there had just been a little more time, it would have been discovered he should not have been able to buy the gun because he had a federal record\n",
      "But because of the Brady bill which Senator Sanders voted against five times, more than two million people, the Brady campaign says, 2\n",
      "We are talking about domestic abusers\n",
      "We are talking about the dangerously mentally ill\n",
      "We are even talking about terrorists because the Republicans won't close the loophole so that people on the no fly zone can buy guns\n",
      "Look, I think this is serious business\n",
      "This is really serious business, who the next president is\n",
      "And that's why I have tried to very clearly explain where I stand on all of these issues because the stakes are so high\n",
      "And if I'm fortunate enough to get the nomination, I will run hard against whomever the Republicans' nominee, because they represent a brand of politics and policies that I think would hurt our country\n",
      "Well, I think the very first phone call would be to whoever I've asked to be the chief of staff of the White House\n",
      "Because I want to really think hard if I do get the nomination, right then and there, how we organize the White House, how we organize the cabinet\n",
      "You have to keep working as hard as you possibly can, but I think it's important to start planning because we know what happens if you get behind in getting your agenda out and getting your appointments made\n",
      "Well, she's right, because I feel very fortunate\n",
      "And so, I think a lot about the future, but I think not just about her future because we're going to do everything we can to make sure she has the best opportunities life can offer, but I think about what kind of country she'll become an adult in and what kind of world is going to be waiting for her\n",
      "I want to make sure—it's not just our grandchild, but every child who has the opportunity to go as far to fulfill their God-given potential as possible\n",
      "That's why I created the children's health care insurance program, because too many didn't\n",
      "Your kids have good education, that's why I'm for early childhood, because too many kids come to school unprepared\n",
      "Too many kids are weeded out because they can't afford to start or stay\n",
      "That is just a fact\n",
      "I don't think he gets the credit he deserves for digging us out and getting us standing again\n",
      "Madam Secretary, thanks so much for joining us\n",
      "He had some tough words for you on Twitter, writing—quote—\\Seriously, why would Hillary call for more sanctions now\n",
      "He also said, whenever he was in Iran, whenever he heard your voice, his heart would sink, because—quote—\\All she ever does with Iran is inflame tensions\n",
      "Well, look, I appreciate what he went through when he was held prisoner in the infamous Iranian prison\n",
      "supervision and is prohibited, it would be a mistake not to make clear to Iran that we are very, very happy to see us implementing the agreement to put a lid on the nuclear weapons program and the way that they have complied, but that doesn't mean they can now go off and invest and test a lot of missiles that would eventually be able to be intercontinental that could reach the United States and maybe carry a very dangerous weapon\n",
      "So, I think there might be a misunderstanding of what our whole agreement consists of, because, certainly, I have made clear I'm proud of the role that I played in getting that agreement in place, but, as president, I will enforce it\n",
      "And, so, obviously that's, you know, something I will leave up to the Sanders campaign\n",
      "But this is a spirited debate, because, although we share some very similar goals for our country, we have differences\n",
      "Now I hope he will flip-flop on what we call the Charleston loophole, and join legislation to close that, because it's been a key argument of my campaign that we Democrats, in fact, Americans need to stand up to the gun lobby and pass comprehensive commonsense gun measures that will make America safer\n",
      "And I think we have now, finally, after many decades of efforts, thanks to President Obama, a plan that will get us to universal health care\n",
      "And I also think it would be a mistake to really thrust our country into another contentious national debate about how we're going to provide quality, affordable health care to everybody\n",
      "very focused on—well, the merits are we need to get to universal health care\n",
      "Oh, I didn't use her\n",
      "And, you know, she gave a factual answer, based on the legislation that is the only way we know what Senator Sanders is actually proposing, because he introduced it nine times in the Congress\n",
      "I'm just too busy campaigning\n",
      "I am still very focused on making sure we do everything we can, as I did when I was secretary of state, as I testified to over 11 hours, to make sure that nothing like that happens again, insofar as we are able to prevent it\n",
      "And that's my focus when it comes to the continuing obligation that the United States government has whenever we send anyone into harm's way\n",
      "Obviously, I thought, at the time, it was the right approach\n",
      "And I advocated for it, along with then Secretary Panetta and CIA Director Petraeus, because I was worried about what would happen if there were a very vicious civil war, when, on one side, you had Assad's army backed by Iran, and now we know also backed by Russia, against a group of people who wanted more freedom, wanted to live in dignity, not the continuing oppression from the Assad regime, that it would be a pretty uneven match, to be understating that, and it could open territory for terrorist groups, foreign fighters, and others to come in\n",
      "And I have laid out a plan to deal with ISIS about airpower that is being used now, with more nations joining the United States, which is in the lead, to try to go after ISIS leadership, infrastructure, other assets, also to support Iraqi and Syrian fighters who are on the ground trying to take territory back from ISIS, and what else we need to do to build up those forces, the Iraqi army, which has had some success taking back Ramadi, Sunni tribal fighters, which we have to get back into the fight, and that is beginning to happen, and supporting the Kurdish fighters, who have been extraordinary brave on both sides of the border, by helping to equip and support them\n",
      "Three polls out this week alone showing neck and neck race including our own NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist polls which had Clinton leading by jut 3; Quinnipiac found Sanders actually up by 5 and the \\Des Moines Register\\ had Clinton up by just 2\n",
      "So as they close the race it has become a more aggressive race against Sanders so we begin with Hillary Clinton who joins Clinton campaign against Sanders and so we begin with Hillary Clinton who joins us from Charleston, South Carolina\n",
      "Look I have said for a long time that I'm very proud of the role that I played in getting us to the point where we could negotiate the agreement that puts a lid on Iran's nuclear weapons program but I've also said that the way we're going to hold them accountable is to have consequences when they do anything that might deviate from the agreement or continue to block the kind of sanctions and mandates the U\n",
      "They need to know that this is a good step forward with respect to the nuclear weapons program but there are other areas of their behavior that we're going to continue to be focused on\n",
      "Well, certainly we have lowered that threat because of the nuclear agreement but they continue to be destabilize governments in the Middle East\n",
      "But what I've said for some time now is I'd rather have the nuclear weapons program off to one side and work to make sure they abide by the agreement and then turn our attention to some of these other behaviors that are threatening, certainly in the region and therefore cause concern for us\n",
      "Well, first of all, Chuck, I always thought this was going to be close and I can't speak for anybody else but I've worked as hard as I can to build an organization in Iowa, to be out there listening and talking with Iowans as they move toward making the first in the nation decision in the caucus on February 1\n",
      "I think that's why I have such strong support and I feel very good about where we are but we're going to just keep working until the very last caucus is decided on February 1\n",
      "What I am worried about is that it's not continuing to do what it used to do which is to give the vast majority of Americans the chance to get ahead and stay ahead\n",
      "That's why I've got a very vigorous jobs agenda\n",
      "Look, when we have a Democrat in the White House—a Democrat—we do that better economically\n",
      "We saw that when my husband was president, we've watched President Obama dig us out of the huge ditch that Republican policies put us into, so I'm very confident that I know what will work if we have a—the right commitment as a nation and that's what I want to do as president\n",
      "Look, like everybody else who watched that video on television I was just outraged by what happened to Laquan McDonald\n",
      "I was one of the first to call for a complete Department of Justice investigation and, in fact, urged that it include the entire Chicago police department\n",
      "My real focus, Chuck, is what do we do to make sure that we send Americans into harm's way—military or civilian, diplomats or our soldiers—we take every precaution to the best of our ability in what is an unpredictable and dangerous world to make sure that they can discharge their duties and be safe while doing it\n",
      "Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton going at it this week as we begin this campaign in 2016 just two weeks from the Iowa caucuses\n",
      "Secretary Clinton joins us now from Charleston, South Carolina, ahead of tonight's big debate\n",
      "They were unjustly held there, and I did a lot of work on these issues when Americans were being picked up, falsely charged and imprisoned, to get them home\n",
      "We still don't see Bob Levinson coming home, so we have unfinished questions and business still\n",
      "They have poured cement into one of the reactors we worried about because of a plutonium potential threat\n",
      "So this is the kind of smart diplomacy I was proud to be a part of in the first administration of President Obama that we're just going to have to be persistent with, because we have a lot of problems with Iran—their aggressive behavior, their destabilizing of neighboring states, their continuing military support for Assad and so much else\n",
      "And that's what I'm focusing on now\n",
      "You know, I have pointed out repeatedly, because I think it's a critical issue, that Senator Sanders has, for years, voted many times on behalf of the NRA gun lobby position\n",
      "And one of the most egregious of those votes was the vote to give immunity from all liability to gun makers and sellers\n",
      "Now, I was happy when - Well, he flip-flopped last night, said that he would sign on to a bill that is currently pending in the House and Senate to repeal that liability\n",
      "And it's called the Charleston loophole because that's how the killer in Charleston got his gun when, if there had been a little more time, information would have come to light that would have shown he was prohibited\n",
      "And, of course, we know he used that gun to go to Mother Emanuel Church and murder nine faithful people at Bible study\n",
      "So I want to see movement against the gun lobby, because we cannot continue to lose 90 people a day, 33,000 a year, to gun violence\n",
      "I want us to protect it, to defend it and to improve it\n",
      "So rather than tear it apart or get rid of it and start all over again in a contentious national debate, let's do what I'm proposing, to get costs down, get out of pocket costs down, get more support for families who face big medical costs\n",
      "I find that, in a perverse way, an incredibly flattering comment on their anxiety, because they know that not only will I stand up for what the country needs, I will take it to the Republicans\n",
      "So I think this just proves my point, that I am the strongest candidate to go up against any Republican\n",
      "But what I find sort of strange is, number one, the ad that Senator Sanders ran was really against all Democrats who ever took any contributions from anybody associated with the financial industry\n",
      "You know, that is just a false charge\n",
      "But in addition, I think it's important for us to look at our respective plans\n",
      "In fact, everyone who has offered an opinion about the plan that Senator Sanders has proposed and the one I put together has said mine is tougher, mine is more comprehensive, it would be more effective, because it tries to get not just at the problems of yesterday, but the potential problems of tomorrow, going after shadow banking and investment banks and big insurance companies, like what we saw in '08 where Lehman Brothers and AIG were principal causes of what happened to us\n",
      "And I think, finally, I would say that I have gotten maybe 3 percent of my - less than 3 percent of my contributions this time from anybody associated with financial industry activities\n",
      "So I'm just - you know, I didn't know about Karl Rove's ad against me, but it kind of boosts me up, because I assume he thinks that I am going to get the nomination and he's trying to interfere with the Iowa caucus to maybe confuse people on their way to caucus for me\n",
      "By the way, as did Marco Rubio on the Republican side but one would argue the \\Des Moines Register\\ will probably have a greater impact among Democratic caucus goers\n",
      "Well Chuck—look, I think it's actually good for the debate that we're having that there is so much interest and energy that I feel on my side and I know, obviously so does senator Sanders on his\n",
      "I'm enthusiastically pursuing the opportunity to reach every single voter in Iowa and we're going to see what happens\n",
      "Obviously, we'll find out a week from tomorrow\n",
      "But if you look at the differences between Senator Sanders and myself, I just don't think we can't wait\n",
      "I just have to tell you, can only react to what I'm doing, feeling, getting responses from people\n",
      "And you know, I feel great that we have the level of enthusiasm that we do and we also have a really good team on the ground that has been working for months to make sure that it's not just here today, gone tomorrow\n",
      "They are really reached out to and yes, we believe they're going to come caucus\n",
      "But we're just going to keep moving forward and do the work that we think is going to be successful on February 1st\n",
      "Because I think at the end of the day people take this vote seriously\n",
      "They know they're voting for who they prefer to be the next president and commander in chief, and I believe that when I am out there talking with people about what we have to go up against here at home, get the economy working for everybody, not just those at the top, begin to raise incomes, which hasn't happened, deal with health care, going from 90 percent coverage, which is what we have under the Affordable Care Act now, to 100 percent and I lay out what intend to do to get there\n",
      "And because of my experience, particularly my years as secretary of state working with President Obama, I think that's something that people really take into account\n",
      "I met a woman yesterday whose bill for the drugs she must take and has taken for 25 years has gone from a couple hundred to over $14,000 for the same amount of the drug\n",
      "I'm going to use whatever tools I can to get us lower prices, cap those prescription drug companies and take that on\n",
      "But I'm also going to focus on the economy because unless we create more jobs and get incomes rising and fix the tax system so that it doesn't in so many ways tilt toward the wealthy, people are not going to get ahead, they're not going to feel they're getting ahead and they're going to still believe that the government, the economy is rigged against them which is bad for our democracy\n",
      "Well, look, I gave speeches to a wide array of groups from health care groups to auto dealers and many, many more, and I think what they were interested in because what we talked about was the world coming off of four years as secretary of state in a complicated world, people were interested in what I saw, what I thought, they asked questions about matters that were on their minds\n",
      "You know, I think Americans who are doing business in every aspect of the economy want to know more about the world\n",
      "Because he knows number one I know what must be done, and number two I know how to get it done to make sure that Wall Street writ large, not just the banks but the investment banks, the hedge funds and everybody else, no longer can wreck our economy the way they did in 2008\n",
      "No, I'm not concerned because I know what the facts are\n",
      "You know, back a couple of months ago Kevin McCarthy spilled the beans that the Benghazi investigation was all about bringing me down, something that I suspected but I went ahead, testified for 11 hours, answered all their questions, and even they admitted there was nothing new\n",
      "He's the chairman of the judiciary committee who has—and his staff have been behind and pushing a lot of these stories, and announces he's there for the simple reason, to defeat me\n",
      "But I know what the facts are and I will just keep putting them out there\n",
      "You have been so generous with your time\n",
      "And I'm just so grateful to be back in Marshalltown and to have this chance to talk with you, now less than a week until the caucus on Monday night\n",
      "But it's just really meaningful to me that you would be here and be part of this process, and I really am grateful to each and every one of you\n",
      "And that is I hope that we will be able to make him the majority leader of the House of Representatives in the state legislature\n",
      "And when all of you decide to go caucus on Monday, you're going to be the first people in the world to get to express an opinion about who should be the next president and commander in chief for our country\n",
      "And I know how seriously Iowans take this because I've been talking with you and listening to you\n",
      "But I want to just spend a few minutes really discussing what's at stake, because this is one of the most consequential elections that we've had in quite some time\n",
      "When you think about it, there are some very big differences between us and the Republicans, and that puts a special responsibility on you and voters to try to decide where you stand\n",
      "And that is true across the board, but let me just pick a few of the most important issues\n",
      "And the facts are that our economy does better when we have a Democrat in the White House who cares about creating jobs and raising incomes for Americans\n",
      "You know, in my husband's case, it was a recession, a huge national debt that had been quadrupled in the prior 12 years and a big deficit\n",
      "Not just those at the top, hard-working middle-class families, working families, poor families\n",
      "And we ended up with a balanced budget and a surplus\n",
      "Bush slashed taxes on the wealthy and got out of the way of corporations to the extent that the man he put in charge of keeping an eye on Wall Street took a chainsaw to a big stack of regulations and had a great big smile on his face\n",
      "I don't think President Obama gets the credit he deserves for digging us out of that big ditch that the Republicans put us in during their administration\n",
      "When he asked me to be secretary of State, he said, \\We got to focus on the economy here at home and we got to fix all the problems that we also inherited around the world\n",
      "He passed and signed the toughest regulations on Wall Street since the 1930s, the Dodd-Frank law; saved the auto industry, which was on the brink of collapse which would have taken another, you know, couple of million jobs down with them\n",
      "We ended up losing 9 million because of that Great Recession, 5 million homes were lost and $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out\n",
      "Now, if you want to go back there, you got a lot of folks, including one who was here today, who are spouting that same stuff, because that's where we'll end up again\n",
      "In fact, you are four times more likely to see a recession in America when you have a Republican in the White House\n",
      "We have work to do in our country, and those are jobs that can't be exported, they need to be done right here and put Americans back to work building our economy, making us more competitive\n",
      "I know it can be done because I've been to some of your community colleges\n",
      "I also know it can be done because while we are going to combat climate change, we're going to create more clean, renewable energy jobs\n",
      "I know we can create those jobs because look at what Iowa has done\n",
      "You have 7,000 people already working in the wind industry in this state\n",
      "So Iowa is in the forefront of the energy revolution because some country is going to be the 21st century clean energy superpower\n",
      "It's either going to be China, Germany, or us\n",
      "I want it to be us, and we need to make up our minds that it is going to be us and we're going to be doing the technology, the innovation and exporting to the rest of the world\n",
      "We also need to be focusing on small business because that's where most of the jobs come from in America\n",
      "And I want to be the small business president\n",
      "My dad was a small businessman, so I want to clear away all the underbrush so people can start businesses again\n",
      "S lot of young people tell me they'd love to go into business, but they can't get credit\n",
      "So we need to make it easier to start and grow a small business\n",
      "Now, everything I've just said to you the Republicans don't agree with it, every bit of it\n",
      "They don't really tell you what they will do except just, you know, get out of the way and let corporations do whatever they want and let their, you know, big donors do whatever they want\n",
      "I do not think it is right——to be going to people who suffered because of the Republican recession and asking for you to help us make the investments for the future\n",
      "So we need to close the loopholes and the special gimmicks that corporations and the wealthy use, like this thing called the \\carried interest loophole\\ that I've been against for years\n",
      "And we were standing there and he——he said, you know, I'm not too popular among my rich friends these days because I think people like me should pay more money into our tax system to support our country\n",
      "Now, there aren't very many of those, but there's a lot of money there because I want to use that money to make college affordable\n",
      "I want to use that money to invest in clean energy\n",
      "I want to use that money to move toward paid family leave so that families get more support to be able to do their work at home and take care of their families\n",
      "I want to use that money to help bring down the cost of child care, which in some states is as expensive as college tuition\n",
      "I've seen a little bit of this in the last 20-plus years\n",
      "Not just a plan on the substance, but a political plan because I want you to know what I aim to do for you and what it will cost you\n",
      "We don't have to do that, we just have to implement it\n",
      "And I have said if they pose a systemic risk to our economy, I will go after them and I will use the process President Obama signed into law\n",
      "You see it wasn't just the big banks that caused our problems, it was an investment bank like Lehman Brothers\n",
      "Barney Frank, who is actually the Frank in Dodd-Frank, said I have the best plan because I'm trying to look not just at what happened in the past to prevent that from happening again, but what could happen in the future\n",
      "Well, I think you know the answer, because they know that I say what I mean, I do what I say I will do, and I know how to get it done, to take after them, to prevent them from——pushing an agenda on us that hurts the economy\n",
      "I mean, the drug companies, the insurance companies spent millions of dollars against us\n",
      "Because, you know, my view is when you're knocked down, you share the human experience because everybody gets knocked down about something\n",
      "He said, we don't insure burning houses\n",
      "This man said, they called my little girls burning houses\n",
      "So I started to work with Democrats and Republicans and we created the Children's Health Insurance Program, and it now insures eight million kids because when you get——you encounter an obstacle, you run into a problem, you've got to keep going\n",
      "You know, the Republicans want to repeal it, and that's what they'll do if they get the White House back\n",
      "I want to go after the predatory pricing that drug companies are using to raise the price of drugs\n",
      "They actually get a tax benefit for advertising all that stuff on TV to us that we never—I can't understand what they're talking about\n",
      "And then in a low voice, under the music, they have somebody saying if you take this drug, you know, your nose will fall off\n",
      "I want us to build on what we have and make it better, and go from 90 percent coverage to 100 percent of Americans\n",
      "And you know the worst part of the idea is they want to turn the entire Social Security trust fund over to Wall Street\n",
      "And then we have to do a better job working with federal, state, and local law enforcement to keep us safe at home, and we have to do a better job sharing intelligence, getting intelligence that will help us prevent attacks\n",
      "But, you know, one of the best things we did was a campaign which said, If you see something suspicious or you hear something suspicious, report it\n",
      "Well, the reason I mention that is because of this\n",
      "The Republican candidates, led by their frontrunner, have been attacking Muslims, right\n",
      "You've heard that, attacking American Muslims, attacking Muslims around the world\n",
      "That's not only shameful, it's dangerous\n",
      "And we need people who are in the community who hear something, see something to report it and not feel like they're being demonized, defamed, insulted, pushed out\n",
      "And certainly, if we're going to defeat ISIS, we need a coalition that includes Muslim nations\n",
      "And I want to let you know where I stand on a lot of the issues that the Republicans have taken positions on because they seem to be against so many of the fundamental rights that I support\n",
      "I also want to keep pushing for criminal justice reform and reform in the incarceration system\n",
      "I just want to say a few closing comments, and then for those of you who want to stay, I will shake your hands and take pictures and you can ask me questions\n",
      "But everybody else can go home and not feel bad about it because I need you to get up tomorrow and help work to get more people to go to the caucus next Monday\n",
      "And I know how to find common ground because I've done it\n",
      "Trump, they give me money because they think I'm so good as a candidate and a senator\n",
      "And with your help, starting at the caucus next Monday night, that's what we will do together\n",
      "I am, you know, anxious, if we can get something set up, to be able to be there\n",
      "Look, I'm ready for the debate, and I hope Senator Sanders will change his mind and join us\n",
      "I don't want to — you know, I don't want to jump the gun and create more problems for everybody trying to get this worked out, so we can all come to agreement that the voters of New Hampshire and America deserve to see us, you know, debating before the New Hampshire primary\n",
      "We're moving into the caucus, as you know so well, on Monday\n",
      "And I'm pushing people to come to agreement so we can all get out there and debate before the New Hampshire primary\n",
      "One of the things that I think has been great about the Democratic side is we really have focused on issues, while the Republicans have been hurling insults\n",
      "And I think the people in Iowa want to go to the caucuses thinking about which one of us as president can actually make a difference in their lives, and that's the case I've been focused on making\n",
      "And you know, clearly, some of the journalists covering us are starting to notice and call him out on it\n",
      "And I know that I have the best plan to rein in Wall Street abuses, to make sure it doesn't ever happen again\n",
      "Lots of folks, from Barney Frank to Paul Krugman, have said that's the case because I don't just go after the big banks\n",
      "You know, we already have the authority to do that under Dodd-Frank, and I have said I would use that authority if they were posing a systemic risk to our economy\n",
      "They're running ads against me and trying to, you know, kind of hoodwink Democrats into voting against me because they know exactly what I will do because they've seen me in action\n",
      "And I have been, you know, pointing out the differences in the approach between myself and Senator Sanders because I know that it's more important we actually make progress than fall back into gridlock\n",
      "But I think it's a lot smarter to try to go from 90 percent to 100 percent than to throw our country into another contentious debate about health care\n",
      "I just think we want to stay on the path of making progress\n",
      "I'm talking to people who are thanking me for the Affordable Care Act because the lifetime limit, the cap has been lifted\n",
      "And a man yesterday in Davenport said to me, I'm so grateful because I've got a granddaughter with a congenital heart condition\n",
      "And I respect the goal because Senator Sanders and I share the same goal\n",
      "I think my way will get us there faster and provide the health care that the people here in Iowa are telling me they are desperately, desperately in need of\n",
      "I think young people of every background, every racial, ethnic, religious background, are, you know, trying to understand how best they can participate in our political system and what the stakes are for them\n",
      "And I said, OK, that's the right question because we've been fighting for this\n",
      "So I think what's happening is, as the campaign goes on, a lot of young people — and let's focus on young women — are moving from the sort of general, either we haven't gone far enough or those fights are over and I don't have to worry about it, to being much more specific\n",
      "And that is a good development because at the end of our efforts here in the primaries, and if I'm so fortunate enough to get the nomination, then I think we fight out an election between a party that believes we've got to continue to address the lacks in our drive for equality, our drive for justice, whether it's racism, sexism, homophobia, you name it — we need to address those gaps, and the other side doesn't even want to admit they exist\n",
      "Thank you for joining us, Madam Secretary\n",
      "I feel so proud and grateful to the thousands of Iowans who have joined this campaign\n",
      "And we're going to keep working as hard as I can and everybody else, until the caucuses conclude tomorrow night\n",
      "That's why I hope everybody who has decided to caucus for me will be sure to come out on Monday night\n",
      "I just have to point out that the timing and some of the leaks that have led up to it are concerning\n",
      "And I just want this matter resolved\n",
      "I take classified information very seriously\n",
      "The final thing I would say because clearly the best answer to all of this is release and disclose these materials is that what I'm told is that this chain of emails very well included a published newspaper report\n",
      "So let's just get it out\n",
      "Let's see what it is and let the American people draw their own conclusions\n",
      "You know, the Republicans are going to continue to use it, beat up on me\n",
      "I've been endorsed by The Brady Campaign and yesterday in a very emotional event in Ames, Iowa, endorsed by Gabby Giffords and her husband, Mark Kelly, because they believe I'm the leader that they want to stand up to the gun lobby, the same with the Human Rights Campaign\n",
      "They concluded I was the leader to protect and advance the cause of the rights of the LGBT community\n",
      "Now that is just the facts\n",
      "People who have known us, people who have evaluated us, people who have concluded what they want in the next president have sided with me\n",
      "They want to make some advances in the House as well as at governor and legislature levels across the country\n",
      "I think I've been subjected, as you know so well, to years of scrutiny and I'm still standing, talking to you in the lead here in Iowa for the caucuses and going on after that\n",
      "And if there are issues, that Republicans and their allies on the Right believe they could use to bring down a Democratic, they're going to use it\n",
      "Obviously I have big goals\n",
      "I want to get to universal coverage; I want to get the economy working for everybody, not just those at the top\n",
      "I am focused on my mission to make sure this country works for everybody, particularly hardworking middle-class families who rightly feel they've been left out and left behind\n",
      "And then when we win I will fight for you in the White House\n",
      "I've got the most dedicated campaign team, the organizers who have been on the ground, the thousands of volunteers\n",
      "So there is just a lot of excitement and energy\n",
      "I'm urging everybody to come out and caucus tonight to be part of this unique American process\n",
      "I hope they will come out and caucus for me\n",
      "Just a lot of innuendo, a lot of attacks\n",
      "I just know that after I testified for 11 hours, answered every question, nothing new came up\n",
      "I take classified information seriously\n",
      "And that's what I'm talking about and that seems to be what is exciting and energizing people as they move toward the caucus tonight\n",
      "And, you know, I regret that that seems to be part of the atmosphere because we need to let this inquiry run its course, get it resolved\n",
      "But I can tell you, Alisyn, that is not on the minds of the literally thousands of people that I have seen in the last few weeks\n",
      "Because the facts are the facts\n",
      "No matter how much selective leaking or anonymous sourcing and all that kind of stuff that goes on, what people want to know is what I can do to be the best possible president for them and their families\n",
      "That last event last night was just overwhelming\n",
      "I know \\The Boston Globe\\ matters and a lot of the newspapers in New Hampshire that have endorsed me and this is very gratifying because, yeah, there is a lot of static that goes on and the Republicans and their allies are determined to do everything they can to try to bring me down\n",
      "Because I don't quit when I'm fighting for what I believe in\n",
      "And I'm just going to stick with it\n",
      "And so when very respectable and responsible outlets like \\The Register\\ or \\The Times\\ or \\The Boston Globe\\ and others look at all the candidates, interview us, ask us really hard questions and conclude that I'm their choice for president, I find that incredibly validating\n",
      "And I do hope that voters pay attention to it because it's a pretty tough vetting process they go through\n",
      "Now we can get frustrated by it\n",
      "Because I want to get back to working together to try to unite this country to make it possible for us to set big goals and achieve them\n",
      "And I think that what voters are looking for is a way out of their frustration\n",
      "I mean, 9 million people lost their jobs and 5 million houses were lost and $13 trillion and family wealth was wiped out\n",
      "Well, what do you say we talk to Hillary Clinton, who's good enough to join us this morning on a very important and busy day\n",
      "So many young people, organizers who fanned out across the state, the thousands of volunteers\n",
      "So we're very committed, very energized and enthusiastic, but it all depends upon who shows up tonight, who comes out to caucus in Iowa\n",
      "And I'm urging everyone who is interested in, committed to caucusing for me to please be there tonight, 6:30\n",
      "I will be there in spirit, because if you stand up for me, I will stand up for you during this campaign and into the White House\n",
      "Well, I think that I have a much better organization, to be just really clear about it\n",
      "I think that we built an organization using a lot of the lessons learned, and we recruited some of the best people that you could find anywhere in the country working in Democratic politics\n",
      "I think that in addition to just knowing more about the caucus process and what we needed to do to build toward this night\n",
      "So all in all, I feel like it's a different energized effort that is really bringing in people from across the state and, indeed, across the country who know what's at stake in this election, understand how really dramatic and drastic it would be if the Republicans were to take back the White House because they would rip out the progress\n",
      "I had to — let's just say that\n",
      "But I've covered a lot of ground and I sure have met many thousands of people and have really learned so much\n",
      "It's obviously exhausting, it takes a lot of concentration\n",
      "There's something so intimate, at least in my experience because I actually try to listen to people and hear what's on their minds when someone tells you about the open heart surgery that their granddaughter had to have as a baby and how they couldn't have afforded it without the Affordable Care Act, or when a young woman says she's just drowning in student debt and needs a way out, that sticks with me\n",
      "That's a — that's a really great question, and thanks for asking it because I get asked that a lot\n",
      "When I'm actually in a position to do so — when, you know, there's a campaign, it's a little bit different — but when I was first lady, I worked to achieve the Children's Health Insurance Program, working across the aisle with both Republicans and Democrats, even reformed our foster care and adoption system, teaming up with Tom DeLay, a very partisan Republican in the House\n",
      "I know in a campaign that distinctions have to be drawn because we have to give voters a real sense of what each of us wants to do, and to hold us accountable for the agenda we put forth\n",
      "I am honored to stand in the long line of American reformers who make up our minds that the status quo is not good enough\n",
      "We do that by securing the nomination, and then we do it by winning and going into that White House as others before have, determined to push forward on the great goals and values that unite us as Americans\n",
      "He is a great public servant who has served Maryland and our country and I am excited about really getting into the debate with Senator Sanders about the best way forward to fight for us and America\n",
      "A Republican vision and candidates that would drive us apart and divide us\n",
      "Because we can't afford that\n",
      "Hillary Clinton has been declared the winner of the Iowa caucuses\n",
      "She beat Bernie Sanders by a razor-thin margin just 0\n",
      "Her campaign claimed victory overnight but the Iowa Democratic Party has just issued the final results\n",
      "They say Hillary Clinton is the winner of the Iowa caucuses\n",
      "And Secretary Clinton is joining us now from Nashua, New Hampshire\n",
      "Madam Secretary, thanks very much for joining us\n",
      "What's your reaction to the official results now declaring you the winner of the Iowa caucuses\n",
      "I feel really good and very grateful to the team I had on the ground, to the tens of thousands of Iowans who volunteered, knocked on doors, came out and caucused last night\n",
      "And I could feel the energy building in the weeks leading up to the caucus\n",
      "I was out there, making my case about what I want to do and what I think our country must do to get real results with more jobs, rising incomes, build on the Affordable Care Act, deal with climate change, clean energy, defend our rights, all the things I feel passionate about\n",
      "And I could just watch and, in fact, in that last week I had so many people come up to me and say that they had decided to support me and it could not have been better\n",
      "And it was wonderful to win the caucus and to have that experience of all the hard work, the grassroots organizing pay off the way it did\n",
      "I'm looking forward to the forum tomorrow night on CNN and then a debate Thursday night, here in New Hampshire, because I think that Democratic voters and other Americans want to know what are the principal differences between me and my friend and opponent, Senator Sanders\n",
      "Well, you know, Wolf, this is really hard to follow because, when we said we would do the debate, they came back with conditions\n",
      "And we've tried to be very accommodating but, you know, we have agreed with everything that they have asked us to do\n",
      "I sure hope he intends to show up in his neighboring state and let the people of New Hampshire see us both on the debate stage\n",
      "We agreed to more debates, something that I wanted to do because I think it's great to debate and we're ready\n",
      "You know, look, I — they — I can say that I believe the Democratic Party of Iowa ran a good caucus from everything that our people told me\n",
      "There was an enormous turnout, which everybody said would tremendously favor Senator Sanders\n",
      "But I think we will have a good contest, talking about what results we can produce, what our records have been, both in domestic policy, foreign policy, national security and I think the people of New Hampshire will get a chance to really evaluate both of us\n",
      "I'm talking about helping to push through a treaty to lower nuclear weapons between us and the Russians when I was secretary of state\n",
      "The emphasis I want to make on small business, my call that young people join our campaign and then be part of making us the clean energy superpower of the 21st century\n",
      "I am very proud that I got the endorsement of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, that I got the endorsement of the Human Rights Campaign, that I got the endorsement of The Brady Campaign and Gabby Giffords and Mark Kelly and so many others, because they know me and they know what I have done\n",
      "My timeframe is next Tuesday and the primary in New Hampshire and then I'll go on to the caucuses in Nevada and the primary at the end of the month in South Carolina and then to the states that lie ahead\n",
      "And I take that as perversely flattering because they also know that I mean what I say and I'll do what I have said, to make sure that they don't ever wreck our economy again\n",
      "Madam Secretary, thank you for joining us\n",
      "Tell us about that sigh of relief and what it meant to you\n",
      "As we all remember, I was not successful in Iowa last time and I know how hard that caucus process is\n",
      "Look, Chris, I really believe that during the last few weeks leading up to the caucus, I could feel the energy building\n",
      "I feel really good about my campaign in New Hampshire and I remember getting off the plane in New Hampshire after the Iowa caucuses last time where I did not win, and I was way behind going into what was then just five days before the primary\n",
      "The level of enthusiasm, people who were with me before, people who were with President Obama in '08, everybody working so hard to support me, to get to that primary, to do everything we possibly can\n",
      "We've got your MSNBC debate on Thursday night, which will give us a chance to reach a larger audience\n",
      "I know how seriously people take it\n",
      "And I just want them to understand what I'm offering, what I believe we can do\n",
      "You know, ideas that sound good on paper but can't create results for people are just that, good ideas on paper\n",
      "Because we're going to be voting for both a president and a commander in chief\n",
      "I was very proud of the many, many young people working for me, volunteering for me, voting, caucusing for me in Iowa, and the ones I have here in New Hampshire, I'm just so impressed with\n",
      "I do think that we have an obligation to keep people focused on what's at stake in this election, and you got close to saying it, Chris\n",
      "I am proud to be in a line of Democratic presidents who just got in there and fought it out, who got civil rights, who got an economy producing high incomes, who got, finally, the affordable care act, something we've been fighting for since Harry Truman\n",
      "I know how hard this is and I totally appreciate how exciting it can be to be involved in a campaign that really just puts out these great big ideas\n",
      "So I'm very energized about this because I like a contest of ideas\n",
      "We're going to be talking about and arguing about issues on our side, they're going to keep insulting each other on the Republican side, but the goal for any sensible American has to be, do not turn the white house over to the Republicans in November\n",
      "And I will give everything I've got to make sure that we preserve the progress we've made, because you're right, it is hard fought\n",
      "We couldn't have idealogues who were just hurling their rhetoric back and forth\n",
      "We've got to produce results now because a democracy is a fragile organism, Chris\n",
      "And welcome back to the CNN Democratic Presidential Town Hall at the Derry Opera House in New Hampshire\n",
      "Thanks very much for being with us\n",
      "I've had just an amazing time\n",
      "I have an uphill climb and I'm going to climb as high and hard as I can because I want to make my case for the people of New Hampshire\n",
      "They've been good to my husband, to me, my family\n",
      "Well, the intensity of the experience and the importance of trying to convey what's at stake in this election, because to me obviously Tuesday is a really big deal with the primary\n",
      "But the goal has to be to prevent the Republicans from getting back into the White House and undoing all the progress that has been made under President Obama\n",
      "I mean, we really have focused on issues\n",
      "And I was somewhat amused today that Senator Sanders has set himself up to be the gatekeeper on who is the progressive because under the definition that was flying around on Twitter and statements by the campaign, Barack Obama would not be a progressive, Joe Biden would not be a progressive, Jeanne Shaheen would not be a progressive, even the late, great Senator Paul Wellstone would not be a progressive\n",
      "But I don't think it helps for the senator to be making those kinds of comparisons because clearly we all share a lot of the same hopes and aspirations for our country that we want to see achieved\n",
      "That's just not anything we need to do\n",
      "But at the same time I'm so impressed by the level, the intensity of commitment of this generation to you know really going after discrimination, going after racism and sexism and the kind of abuses that LGBT community members have, looking for ways to bring more justice in the economy and the environment, fighting climate change\n",
      "Sanders to explain because that certainly is the core of his message to young people\n",
      "I think the progress that we have made, and particularly the Democratic Party has made, has been hard fought for, hard won and must be defended\n",
      "And they tried 62 times just to turn it back to the insurance companies\n",
      "I know what it's like to go up against the status quo and special interests\n",
      "Sanders that we should start over, that we should throw our country into a contentious national debate about health care again\n",
      "I do have a litmus test\n",
      "I have a bunch of litmus tests because I agree with you\n",
      "You know one of the many reasons why we can't turn the White House over to the Republicans again is because of the Supreme Court\n",
      "I'm looking for people who understand the way the real world works, who don't have a kneejerk reaction to support business, to support the idea that you know money is speech, that gutted the Voting Rights Act\n",
      "Bush\n",
      "They have a view that I just fundamentally disagree with about what the way we have to keep the balance of power in our society is\n",
      "And here's how I think about it, because when I was a senator, I had to vote on Supreme Court justices\n",
      "I'm looking for people who are rooted in the real world, who know that part of the genius of our system, both economic and government, is this balance of power\n",
      "If it gets too far out of whack, so that business has too much power, any branch of the government has too much power, the delicate balance that makes up our political system and the broad-based prosperity we should be working for in our economy is the worse off for it\n",
      "And I thank you for it, because we need to have a conversation in our country\n",
      "But the issue is whether the medical professionals want to be involved or just be counselors\n",
      "So it is a crucial issue that people deserve to understand from their own ethical, religious, faith-based perspective\n",
      "I want — I want, as president, to try to catalyze that debate because I — I believe you're right, this is going to become an issue more and more\n",
      "We are, on the good side, having many people live longer, but often, then, with very serious illnesses that they can be sustained on, but at some point, don't want to continue with the challenges that poses\n",
      "I think I would want to really immerse myself in the — the — the ethical writings, the health writings, the scientific writings, the religious writings\n",
      "Because we — we have to be sure that nobody is coerced, nobody is under duress\n",
      "And military force must always be a last resort not a first choice\n",
      "I will do everything I possibly can to avoid sending American troops abroad, getting us involved in military conflicts\n",
      "But I can't in good conscious stand here and tell you that there would never be any circumstances in the time that I served as President where it very well might be in America's best vital national security interest\n",
      "We will continue to use Special Forces, and we have to because of the kinds of threats we face\n",
      "You know, the network of terrorist organizations — not just ISIS, but others who are part of this unfortunate network that stretches from North Africa to South Asia — pose serious threats to friends, allies, and partners, as well as to ourselves\n",
      "So I will be a very careful, deliberate decision maker when facing hard choices, because I know what's at stake\n",
      "You know, from my perspective, the all-volunteer military has worked, and we should not do anything that undermines it because it has provided a solid core of people who are willing to serve our country\n",
      "I have a hard time imagining the kind of national emergency that would require the use of the Selective Service system\n",
      "So I just have to be better informed about why they're making this recommendation\n",
      "And in large measure that mistake really arose from the Bush administration's approach to what they thought they could accomplish in Iraq\n",
      "The very explicit appeal that President Bush made before announcing the invasion that getting that vote would be a strong piece of leverage in order to finish the inspections\n",
      "Inspector Hans Blix said, give us the time, we will find out\n",
      "Give us the hammer over their head, namely the vote, and we will be able to find out what they still have in terms of WMD\n",
      "And the Bush administration didn't give them the time\n",
      "But you know I gave them the vote, in large measure because I thought that would give us the time and we would find out, short of invasion\n",
      "And I really regret that that's the way President Bush proceeded\n",
      "And you know I was just unrecognizable to myself\n",
      "I was just stunned\n",
      "And I have had to learn to take criticism seriously, but not personally\n",
      "People ask you questions or criticize you, think about it seriously\n",
      "But don't take it personally so that it just paralyzes you, literally stops you in your tracks\n",
      "And so now that I've been through this for so many years, Sean, my understanding of the political tactics that the other side uses is pretty well versed\n",
      "I view that as perversely flattering because clearly they know I mean what I say and I will do what I say\n",
      "I said today in Dover, you know, I don't think all of the Republican candidates are so ill-informed about climate change that they say they don't know because they're not scientists\n",
      "They're just doing the bidding of the Koch brothers\n",
      "They're told don't you dare say climate change is real because we're in the fossil fuel business\n",
      "it is probably — look, at this point it's probably not correct to say it's a conspiracy because it's out in the open\n",
      "So just know what we're up against because it's real and we're going to beat it\n",
      "Well, thank you for starting by saying it's related to what I just said\n",
      "When you have been subjected to the level, the velocity of attacks that come every day, even if there is no factual basis to it, it's just normal for people to say, gosh, there has got to be something, why do they keep saying this and then we do that\n",
      "And I was able to just keep going and tell people, here's who I am, here's what I do, I want to do this with you\n",
      "And he wins and turns and asks me to be his secretary of state, because he trusts me, he trusts my judgment, he trusts my experience\n",
      "So all I can do is to just get up every day and work to do what I believe our country needs, find ways to help people, whether it's on mental health or addiction or autism or student loans, whatever it might be\n",
      "And I trust the American people\n",
      "I trust the people of New Hampshire to see my lifetime of work and service and to sort out all of the static and to know that I will work my heart out for you\n",
      "Um, I feel very fortunate that I am a person of faith, that I was raised in my church and that I have had to deal and struggle with a lot of these issues about ambition and humility, about service and self-gratification, all of the human questions that all of us deal with, but when you put yourself out into the public arena, I think it's incumbent upon you to be as self- conscious as possible\n",
      "I met my husband, who was such a natural, knew exactly what he wanted to do\n",
      "So I'm constantly trying to balance how do I assume the mantle of a position as essentially august as president of the United States not lose track of who I am, what I believe in and what I want to do to serve\n",
      "And I don't know that there is any ever absolute answer, like, OK, universe, here I am, watch me roar or oh, my gosh, I can't do it, it's just overwhelming, I have to retreat\n",
      "And, you know, it just gets me grounded\n",
      "I have friends who are rabbis who send me notes, give me readings that are going to be discussed in services\n",
      "And the final thing I would say, because again, it's not anything I've ever talked about this much publicly, everybody knows I — I have lived a very public life for the last 25 or so years\n",
      "And I — I read that parable and there was a line in it that became just a lifeline for me\n",
      "And that has helped me enormously\n",
      "Well, look, that's just not the case\n",
      "And I did represent New York, obviously\n",
      "So I just find it kind of a strange argument\n",
      "I'm not just going after Wall Street though\n",
      "I think we need to go after a company like Johnson Controls that is trying to avoid paying taxes after all of us bailed it out by pretending to sell itself in a so-called inversion in Europe\n",
      "So I take seriously the obligation that I would have as president once again to try to get the deck un-stacked, to get the odds favoring the average American again\n",
      "And but I just have to — I have to respectfully say, I think Sen\n",
      "It wasn't just the big banks\n",
      "And if all you do is look over here, I'm telling you, they're going to be over there in the shadow banking sector just cooking up all kinds of ways to once again put our economy at risk\n",

      "The Republicans wanted the auto industry to just fail\n",
      "All of us paid for it\n",
      "And the auto industry just had a great year\n",
      "And we need to be focused on getting a fix for that\n",
      "The circumstances, the concerns I had about the Republicans taking back the White House, because I think they wrecked what we achieved in the 1990s with 23 million new jobs and incomes going up for everybody\n",
      "Just name one thing\n",
      "No, I don't, because, you know, I don't feel that I paid any price for it and I am very clear about what I will do and they're on notice\n",
      "I will do a lot, Chris, because we have an opportunity to do much more with respect to research into marijuana, what it can do to help people with the kinds of conditions you've just briefly described\n",
      "Because I want you to know what we know from science\n",
      "But I also want you to be able to use it while we're doing the research\n",

      "I just left a rally in Manchester, and a woman grabbed my hand and she said, I just lost my son to an overdose\n",
      "So I have been working with elected officials like Senator Shaheen, like Governor Hassan, like Governor Shumlin of Vermont, who supports me, to try to figure out how do we put together a new approach, a new law enforcement approach so that first-time, low-level drug users are not sent to jail but instead we have more treatment and recovery programs\n",
      "I want them to know that I was a legal services lawyers, standing up for equality under the law, defending people's rights because I believe passionately that those of us who have the opportunity to serve should serve\n",

      "And I would tell the Secret Service they had to wear casual clothes, they had to take the things out of their ears, they had to look like they were just tourists\n",
      "And a family would come up and say, would you mind taking our picture in front of the White House\n",
      "So, you know, there's nothing I like better than to be anonymous, as hard as that is to achieve\n",

      "I'm focused on OK, what do we do now\n",

      "I always knew that Senator Sanders been in public life next door for 25 years, he's on the Congress for that long, he had a tremendous amount of familiarity and a sense of really belonging in the area\n",
      "Well, here's my view, and I think Bill was really defending my supporters because we know a lot of them are being harassed online, they're being harassed at our events\n",

      "So, we have a long list and I brought some folks with me who are going to stay involved and help with that planning process and we have a big lack of trust, and one of the things that I have advocated is we need to find a way, not just to empower, but to hire people in the community, to be the outreach workers, to do the water delivery, to be on the front lines in their neighborhoods\n",

      "The biggest concern with the deal is not necessarily that Iran is going to violate it, because already as you know, it has\n",
      "Yes, it places limits on its military nuclear program for only a certain number of years, but when those restrictions expire, Iran will have an industrial-sized military nuclear capability ready to go and with zero provision for delay no matter how bad Iran's behavior is\n",
      "When I'm president, I will adopt a strategy that focuses on three things when it comes to Iran\n",
      "First, we will stand up to Iran's aggressive push to destabilize and dominate the region\n",
      "Secondly, we will totally dismantle Iran's global terror network, which is big and powerful, but not powerful like us\n",

      "And we will never allow Israel's adversaries to think a wedge can be driven between us\n",
      "Indeed, at a time of unprecedented chaos and conflict in the region, America needs an Israel strong enough to deter and defend against its enemies, strong enough to work with us to tackle shared challenges and strong enough to take bold steps in the pursuit of peace\n",

      "I really believe the United States, Israel and the world are safer as a result, but still, as I laid out in a speech at the Brookings Institution last year, it's not good enough to trust and verify\n",

      "At our best, both Israel and America are seen as a light unto the nations because of those values\n",
      "I know that I do and it's why we cannot be neutral about Israel and Israel's future, because in Israel's story, we see our own and the story of all people who struggle for freedom and self-determination\n",
      "We see the vigorous, even raucous debate in Israeli politics and feel right at home\n",
      "And of course, some of us remember a woman, Golda Meir, leading Israel's government decades ago and wonder what's taking us so long here in America\n",
      "But we cannot rest on what previous generations have accomplished\n",
      "Now, in a democracy, we're going to have differences, but what Americans are hearing on the campaign trail this year is something else entirely, encouraging violence, playing coy with white supremacists, calling for 12 million immigrants to be rounded up and deported, demanding we turn away refugees because of their religion and proposing a ban on all Muslims entering the United States\n",

      "\\ So my friends, let us never be neutral or silent in the face of bigotry\n",
      "Let us do the hard work necessary to keep building our friendship and reach out to the next generation of Americans and Israelis so the bonds between our nations grow even deeper and stronger\n",
      "It is time to shake the rust off of America's foreign policy\n",
      "The direction I will outline today will also return us to a timeless principle\n",
      "But to chart our path forward, we must first briefly look back\n",
      "It all began with the dangerous idea that we could make Western democracies out of countries that had no experience or interest in becoming a Western Democracy\n",
      "Civil war, religious fanaticism; thousands of American lives, and many trillions of dollars, were lost as a result\n",
      "Iran, too, would rush in and fill the void, much to their unjust enrichment\n",
      "Thank you San Diego for that warm, warm welcome and thanks to Ellen for those moving words, her introduction, and for reminding us it's not only our men and women in uniform that serve our country, it's their families, their spouses, their children, and we are grateful to each and every one of them\n",

      "As a candidate for President, there's nothing I take more seriously than our national security\n",
      "Because as you know so well, Americans aren't just electing a President in November\n",
      "Donald Trump's ideas aren't just different – they are dangerously incoherent\n",
      "They're not even really ideas – just a series of bizarre rants, personal feuds, and outright lies\n",
      "He is not just unprepared – he is temperamentally unfit to hold an office that requires knowledge, stability and immense responsibility\n",
      "This is not someone who should ever have the nuclear codes – because it's not hard to imagine Donald Trump leading us into a war just because somebody got under his very thin skin\n",
      "This is someone who has threatened to abandon our allies in NATO – the countries that work with us to root out terrorists abroad before they strike us at home\n",
      "economy like one of his casinos and default on our debts to the rest of the world, which would cause an economic catastrophe far worse than anything we experienced in 2008\n",
      "He has said that he would order our military to carry out torture and the murder of civilians who are related to suspected terrorists – even though those are war crimes\n",
      "He says he doesn't have to listen to our generals or our admirals, our ambassadors and other high officials, because he has – quote – 'a very good brain\n",
      "He says he has foreign policy experience because he ran the Miss Universe pageant in Russia\n",
      "And they're the words of someone who would lead us in the wrong direction\n",
      "Because if you really believe America is weak – with our military, our values, our capabilities that no other country comes close to matching – then you don't know America\n",
      "That's why – even if I weren't in this race – I'd be doing everything I could to make sure Donald Trump never becomes President – because I believe he will take our country down a truly dangerous path\n",
      "I wrestled with the Chinese over a climate deal in Copenhagen, brokered a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, negotiated the reduction of nuclear weapons with Russia, twisted arms to bring the world together in global sanctions against Iran, and stood up for the rights of women, religious minorities and LGBT people around the world\n",
      "And I'm proud to run on my record, because I think the choice before the American people in this election is clear\n",
      "And if America doesn't lead, we leave a vacuum – and that will either cause chaos, or other countries will rush in to fill the void\n",
      "Then they'll be the ones making the decisions about your lives and jobs and safety – and trust me, the choices they make will not be to our benefit\n",
      "As I see it, there are some important things our next President must do to secure American leadership and keep us safe and our economy growing in the years ahead\n",
      "We need to reduce income inequality, because our country can't lead effectively when so many are struggling to provide the basics for their families\n",
      "And that would make us weaker in the world\n",
      "America's network of allies is part of what makes us exceptional\n",
      "And our allies deliver for us every day\n",
      "And they share intelligence that helps us identify and defuse potential threats\n",
      "When I was Secretary of State, we worked closely with our allies Japan and South Korea to respond to this threat, including by creating a missile defense system that stands ready to shoot down a North Korean warhead, should its leaders ever be reckless enough to launch one at us\n",
      "And it's the legacy of American troops who fought and died to secure those bonds, because they knew we were safer with friends and partners\n",
      "Now Moscow and Beijing are deeply envious of our alliances around the world, because they have nothing to match them\n",
      "They'd love for us to elect a President who would jeopardize that source of strength\n",
      "Third, we need to embrace all the tools of American power, especially diplomacy and development, to be on the frontlines solving problems before they threaten us at home\n",
      "Now we must enforce that deal vigorously\n",
      "And as I've said many times before, our approach must be 'distrust and verify\n",
      "' The world must understand that the United States will act decisively if necessary, including with military action, to stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon\n",
      "But that would have meant no more global sanctions, and Iran resuming their nuclear program and the world blaming us\n",
      "Just like being interviewed on the same episode of \\60 Minutes\\ as Putin was, is not the same thing as actually dealing with Putin\n",
      "In fact, he is downright contemptuous of that work\n",
      "And that means he's much more likely to end up leading us into conflict\n",
      "Countries like Russia and China often work against us\n",
      "Now I've gone toe-to-toe with Russia and China, and many other different leaders around the world\n",
      "So I know we have to be able to both stand our ground when we must, and find common ground when we can\n",
      "That's how I could work with Russia to conclude the New START treaty to reduce nuclear stockpiles, and with China to increase pressure on North Korea\n",
      "The key was never forgetting who we were dealing with – not friends or allies, but countries that share some common interests with us amid many disagreements\n",
      "I just wonder how anyone could be so wrong about who America's real friends are\n",
      "Because it matters\n",
      "We need to keep pursuing diplomacy to end Syria's civil war and close Iraq's sectarian divide, because those conflicts are keeping ISIS alive\n",
      "Just look at the few things he's actually said on the subject\n",
      "Then he said we should send tens of thousands of American ground troops to the Middle East to fight ISIS\n",
      "He also refused to rule out using nuclear weapons against ISIS, which would mean mass civilian casualties\n",
      "And through all his loose talk, there's one constant theme: demonizing Muslims and playing right into the hands of ISIS'\n",
      "5 billion Muslims from even coming to our country doesn't just violate the religious freedom our country was founded on\n",
      "And it alienates the very countries we need to actually help us in this fight\n",
      "A President has a sacred responsibility to send our troops into battle only if we absolutely must, and only with a clear and well-thought-out strategy\n",
      "Trump says over and over again, 'The world is laughing at us\n",
      "' He's been saying this for decades, he didn't just start this year\n",
      "He bought full-page ads in newspapers across the country back in 1987, when Ronald Reagan was President, saying that America lacked a backbone and the world was – you guessed it – laughing at us\n",
      "The truth is, there's not a country in the world that can rival us\n",
      "It's not just that we have the greatest military, or that our economy is larger, more durable, more entrepreneurial than any in the world\n",
      "It matters when he says he'll order our military to murder the families of suspected terrorists\n",
      "Trump – every time you insult American Muslims or Mexican immigrants, remember that plenty of Muslims and immigrants serve and fight in our armed forces\n",
      "It also takes humility – knowing you don't know everything – because if you're convinced you're always right, you'll never ask yourself the hard questions\n",
      "And when he did, it was as crisp and courageous a display of leadership as I've ever seen\n",
      "Imagine him deciding whether to send your spouses or children into battle\n",
      "Imagine if he had not just his Twitter account at his disposal when he's angry, but America's entire arsenal\n",
      "Because making Donald Trump our commander-in-chief would be a historic mistake\n",
      "And it would fuel an ugly narrative about who we are – that we're fearful, not confident; that we want to let others determine our future for us, instead of shaping our own destiny\n",
      "Every lesson from our history teaches us that we are stronger together\n",
      "The other is hopeful, generous, and confident in the knowledge that America is great – just like we always have been\n",
      "That plane – those words – our country represents something special, not just to us, to the world\n",
      "There will be plenty of opportunity to discuss these important issues at a later time, and I will deliver that speech soon\n",
      "But today there is only one thing to discuss: the growing threat of terrorism inside of our borders\n",
      "A radical Islamic terrorist targeted the nightclub not only because he wanted to kill Americans, but in order to execute gay and lesbian citizens because of their sexual orientation\n",
      "The killer, whose name I will not use, or ever say, was born to Afghan parents who immigrated to the United States\n",
      "The bottom line is that the only reason the killer was in America in the first place was because we allowed his family to come here\n",
      "We have a dysfunctional immigration system which does not permit us to know who we let into our country, and it does not permit us to protect our citizens\n",
      "We have an incompetent administration, and if I am not elected President, that will not change over the next four years -- but it must change, and it must change now\n",
      "I called for a ban after San Bernardino, and was met with great scorn and anger but now, many are saying I was right to do so -- and although the pause is temporary, we must find out what is going on\n",
      "The immigration laws of the United States give the President the power to suspend entry into the country of any class of persons that the President deems detrimental to the interests or security of the United States, as he deems appropriate\n",
      "I will use this power to protect the American people\n",
      "When I am elected, I will suspend immigration from areas of the world when there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies, until we understand how to end these threats\n",
      "We cannot continue to allow thousands upon thousands of people to pour into our country, many of whom have the same thought process as this savage killer\n",
      "I refuse to allow America to become a place where gay people, Christian people, and Jewish people, are the targets of persecution and intimidation by Radical Islamic preachers of hate and violence\n",
      "It's not just a national security issue\n",
      "Immigration from Afghanistan into the United States has increased nearly five-fold in just one year\n",
      "Yet, Hillary Clinton – for months and despite so many attacks – repeatedly refused to even say the words \\radical Islam,\\ until I challenged her yesterday to say the words or leave the race\n",
      "However, Hillary Clinton – who has been forced to say the words today after policies she supports have caused us so much damage – still has no clue what Radical Islam is, and won't speak honestly about what it is\n",
      "In fact, just a few weeks before the San Bernardino slaughter, Hillary Clinton explained her refusal to say the words Radical Islam\n",
      "Here is what she said: \\Muslims are peaceful and tolerant people, and have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism\n",
      "She wants to take away Americans' guns, then admit the very people who want to slaughter us\n",
      "I will be meeting with the NRA, which has given me their earliest endorsement in a Presidential race, to discuss how to ensure Americans have the means to protect themselves in this age of terror\n",
      "I refuse to be politically correct\n",

      "Each year, the United States permanently admits more than 100,000 immigrants from the Middle East, and many more from Muslim countries outside the Middle East\n",
      "Altogether, under the Clinton plan, you'd be admitting hundreds of thousands of refugees from the Middle East with no system to vet them, or to prevent the radicalization of their children\n",

      "The core lesson from her childhood was that none of us gets through life alone\n",
      "My colleagues and I at the Children's Defense Fund, along with others, gathered the facts, and we built a coalition of activists and families across America, and together we helped convince Congress to pass a groundbreaking law saying that children with disabilities have the same right to be educated in public school just like any other kids\n",

      "So what they're doing is they're leaving our country, and they're, believe it or not, leaving because taxes are too high and because some of them have lots of money outside of our country\n",
      "And instead of bringing it back and putting the money to work, because they can't work out a deal to—and everybody agrees it should be brought back\n",
      "Instead of that, they're leaving our country to get their money, because they can't bring their money back into our country, because of bureaucratic red tape, because they can't get together\n",
      "Because we have—we have a president that can't sit them around a table and get them to approve something\n",
      "And with a little leadership, you'd get it in here very quickly, and it could be put to use on the inner cities and lots of other things, and it would be beautiful\n",
      "Our country is suffering because people like Secretary Clinton have made such bad decisions in terms of our jobs and in terms of what's going on\n",
      "And believe me: The day Obama goes off, and he leaves, and goes out to the golf course for the rest of his life to play golf, when they raise interest rates, you're going to see some very bad things happen, because the Fed is not doing their job\n",
      "It shows income—in fact, the income—I just looked today—the income is filed at $694 million for this past year, $694 million\n",
      "When we have a country that's doing so badly, that's being ripped off by every single country in the world, it's the kind of thinking that our country needs, because everybody—Lester, we have a trade deficit with all of the countries that we do business with, of almost $800 billion a year\n",
      "Excuse me\n",
      "The report that said $650—which, by the way, a lot of friends of mine that know my business say, boy, that's really not a lot of money\n",
      "I have a tremendous income\n",
      "It's because it's about time that this country had somebody running it that has an idea about money\n",
      "And we've spent $6 trillion in the Middle East, according to a report that I just saw\n",

      "Our country has tremendous problems\n",
      "We're a serious debtor nation\n",

      "When we look at the budget, the budget is bad to a large extent because we have people that have no idea as to what to do and how to buy\n",
      "Well, first of all, Secretary Clinton doesn't want to use a couple of words, and that's law and order\n",
      "And when I look at what's going on in Charlotte, a city I love, a city where I have investments, when I look at what's going on throughout various parts of our country, whether it's—I mean, I can just keep naming them all day long—we need law and order in our country\n",

      "But just last week, your campaign manager said it was true\n",

      "She's saying Russia, Russia, Russia, but I don't—maybe it was\n",
      "I mean, it could be Russia, but it could also be China\n",
      "Now, whether that was Russia, whether that was China, whether it was another country, we don't know, because the truth is, under President Obama we've lost control of things that we used to have control over\n",
      "We came in with the Internet, we came up with the Internet, and I think Secretary Clinton and myself would agree very much, when you look at what ISIS is doing with the Internet, they're beating us at our own game\n",
      "\\ Well, President Obama and Secretary Clinton created a vacuum the way they got out of Iraq, because they got out—what, they shouldn't have been in, but once they got in, the way they got out was a disaster\n",
      "Or, as I've been saying for a long time, and I think you'll agree, because I said it to you once, had we taken the oil—and we should have taken the oil—ISIS would not have been able to form either, because the oil was their primary source of income\n",
      "And you have to understand, I'm a businessperson\n",
      "Number two—and that bothers me, because we should be asking—we're defending them, and they should at least be paying us what they're supposed to be paying by treaty and contract\n",
      "And, number two, I said, and very strongly, NATO could be obsolete, because—and I was very strong on this, and it was actually covered very accurately in the New York Times, which is unusual for the New York Times, to be honest—but I said, they do not focus on terror\n",
      "And I said it numerous times\n",
      "And I think we should get—because we pay approximately 73 percent of the cost of NATO\n",
      "But I said they have to focus on terror, also\n",
      "And that was—believe me—I'm sure I'm not going to get credit for it—but that was largely because of what I was saying and my criticism of NATO\n",
      "I think we have to get NATO to go into the Middle East with us, in addition to surrounding nations, and we have to knock the hell out of ISIS, and we have to do it fast, when ISIS formed in this vacuum created by Barack Obama and Secretary Clinton\n",
      "That is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her, because she—frankly, I think the best person in her campaign is mainstream media\n",

      "And Sean Hannity said—and he called me the other day—and I spoke to him about it—he said you were totally against the war, because he was for the war\n",
      "And when he—excuse me\n",
      "He said, you used to have fights with me, because Sean was in favor of the war\n",
      "And I understand that side, also, not very much, because we should have never been there\n",

      "No, they were taunting us\n",

      "But they should be paying us, because we are providing tremendous service and we're losing a fortune\n",
      "All I said, that it's very possible that if they don't pay a fair share, because this isn't 40 years ago where we could do what we're doing\n",
      "We can't defend Japan, a behemoth, selling us cars by the million\n",
      "All I said was, they may have to defend themselves or they have to help us out\n",
      "They have to help us out\n",
      "Well, I have to say that, you know, for what Secretary Clinton was saying about nuclear with Russia, she's very cavalier in the way she talks about various countries\n",
      "But Russia has been expanding their—they have a much newer capability than we do\n",
      "I would like everybody to end it, just get rid of it\n",
      "Because you look at some of these countries, you look at North Korea, we're doing nothing there\n",
      "China should solve that problem for us\n",
      "7 billion in cash, obviously, I guess for the hostages\n",
      "Right now, it's getting tougher and tougher to defeat them, because they're in more and more places, more and more states, more and more nations\n",
      "where they're not paying us what we need\n",
      "And she doesn't say that, because she's got no business ability\n",
      "To be president of this country, you need tremendous stamina\n",
      "Let me just tell you\n",
      "You know, Hillary is hitting me with tremendous commercials\n",
      "Some of it's said—somebody who's been very vicious to me, Rosie O'Donnell, I said very tough things to her, and I think everybody would agree that she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her\n",
      "I just can't do it\n",
      "We are a nation that is seriously troubled\n",
      "Well, thank you, Lester, and thanks to Hofstra for hosting us\n",
      "First, we have to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top\n",
      "I want us to invest in you\n",
      "I want us to invest in your future\n",
      "That means jobs in infrastructure, in advanced manufacturing, innovation and technology, clean, renewable energy, and small business, because most of the new jobs will come from small business\n",
      "If you help create the profits, you should be able to share in them, not just the executives at the top\n",
      "And I want us to do more to support people who are struggling to balance family and work\n",
      "You have to judge us, who can shoulder the immense, awesome responsibilities of the presidency, who can put into action the plans that will make your life better\n",
      "We also, though, need to have a tax system that rewards work and not just financial transactions\n",
      "I call it trumped-up trickle-down, because that's exactly what it would be\n",
      "We just have a different view about what's best for growing the economy, how we make investments that will actually produce jobs and rising incomes\n",
      "He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there\n",
      "My father was a small-businessman\n",
      "That's the kind of economy I want us to see again\n",
      "That was in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy, failed to invest in the middle class, took their eyes off of Wall Street, and created a perfect storm\n",
      "In fact, Donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis\n",
      "He said, back in 2006, \\Gee, I hope it does collapse, because then I can go in and buy some and make some money\n",
      "So we're now on the precipice of having a potentially much better economy, but the last thing we need to do is to go back to the policies that failed us in the first place\n",
      "They've looked at my plans and they've said, OK, if we can do this, and I intend to get it done, we will have 10 million more new jobs, because we will be making investments where we can grow the economy\n",
      "So I've tried to be very specific about what we can and should do, and I am determined that we're going to get the economy really moving again, building on the progress we've made over the last eight years, but never going back to what got us in trouble in the first place\n",
      "I think my husband did a pretty good job in the 1990s\n",
      "And because I hold the same standards as I look at all of these trade deals\n",
      "Well, that is just not accurate\n",
      "But it's because I see this—we need to have strong growth, fair growth, sustained growth\n",
      "We also have to look at how we help families balance the responsibilities at home and the responsibilities at business\n",
      "So we have a very robust set of plans\n",
      "And people have looked at both of our plans, have concluded that mine would create 10 million jobs and yours would lose us 3\n",
      "Because what I have proposed\n",
      "What I have proposed would cut regulations and streamline them for small businesses\n",
      "What I have proposed would be paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy, because they have made all the gains in the economy\n",
      "You know, just join the debate by saying more crazy things\n",
      "I don't see changes in the corporate tax rates or the kinds of proposals you're referring to that would cause the repatriation, bringing back of money that's stranded overseas\n",
      "But when I look at what you have proposed, you have what is called now the Trump loophole, because it would so advantage you and the business you do\n",
      "It got us into the mess we were in, in 2008 and 2009\n",
      "Broad-based, inclusive growth is what we need in America, not more advantages for people at the very top\n",
      "Third, we don't know all of his business dealings, but we have been told through investigative reporting that he owes about $650 million to Wall Street and foreign banks\n",
      "Or maybe he doesn't want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he's paid nothing in federal taxes, because the only years that anybody's ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license, and they showed he didn't pay any federal income tax\n",
      "And I think probably he's not all that enthusiastic about having the rest of our country see what the real reasons are, because it must be something really important, even terrible, that he's trying to hide\n",
      "And it just seems to me that this is something that the American people deserve to see\n",
      "And I have no reason to believe that he's ever going to release his tax returns, because there's something he's hiding\n",
      "But I think the question is, were he ever to get near the White House, what would be those conflicts\n",
      "You know, I made a mistake using a private e- mail\n",
      "And if I had to do it over again, I would, obviously, do it differently\n",
      "But I'm not going to make any excuses\n",
      "And maybe because you haven't paid any federal income tax for a lot of years\n",
      "is if your—if your main claim to be president of the United States is your business, then I think we should talk about that\n",
      "You know, your campaign manager said that you built a lot of businesses on the backs of little guys\n",
      "And, indeed, I have met a lot of the people who were stiffed by you and your businesses, Donald\n",
      "I've met dishwashers, painters, architects, glass installers, marble installers, drapery installers, like my dad was, who you refused to pay when they finished the work that you asked them to do\n",
      "We have an architect in the audience who designed one of your clubhouses at one of your golf courses\n",
      "It immediately was put to use\n",
      "Do the thousands of people that you have stiffed over the course of your business not deserve some kind of apology from someone who has taken their labor, taken the goods that they produced, and then refused to pay them\n",
      "I can only say that I'm certainly relieved that my late father never did business with you\n",
      "He provided a good middle-class life for us, but the people he worked for, he expected the bargain to be kept on both sides\n",
      "And when we talk about your business, you've taken business bankruptcy six times\n",
      "There are a lot of great businesspeople that have never taken bankruptcy once\n",
      "Well, sometimes there's not a direct transfer of skills from business to government, but sometimes what happened in business would be really bad for government\n",
      "Unfortunately, race still determines too much, often determines where people live, determines what kind of education in their public schools they can get, and, yes, it determines how they're treated in the criminal justice system\n",
      "We've just seen those two tragic examples in both Tulsa and Charlotte\n",
      "We have to restore trust between communities and the police\n",
      "We have to work to make sure that our police are using the best training, the best techniques, that they're well prepared to use force only when necessary\n",
      "So I have, ever since the first day of my campaign, called for criminal justice reform\n",
      "I've laid out a platform that I think would begin to remedy some of the problems we have in the criminal justice system\n",
      "The gun epidemic is the leading cause of death of young African- American men, more than the next nine causes put together\n",
      "We have to restore trust\n",
      "You know, the vibrancy of the black church, the black businesses that employ so many people, the opportunities that so many families are working to provide for their kids\n",
      "Stop-and-frisk was found to be unconstitutional and, in part, because it was ineffective\n",
      "We just don't want to see it creep back up\n",
      "And it's just a fact that if you're a young African-American man and you do the same thing as a young white man, you are more likely to be arrested, charged, convicted, and incarcerated\n",
      "So we've got to address the systemic racism in our criminal justice system\n",
      "We cannot just say law and order\n",
      "We have to say—we have to come forward with a plan that is going to divert people from the criminal justice system, deal with mandatory minimum sentences, which have put too many people away for too long for doing too little\n",
      "And I believe strongly that commonsense gun safety measures would assist us\n",
      "If you're too dangerous to fly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun\n",
      "Lester, I think implicit bias is a problem for everyone, not just police\n",
      "I think, unfortunately, too many of us in our great country jump to conclusions about each other\n",
      "And therefore, I think we need all of us to be asking hard questions about, you know, why am I feeling this way\n",
      "But when it comes to policing, since it can have literally fatal consequences, I have said, in my first budget, we would put money into that budget to help us deal with implicit bias by retraining a lot of our police officers\n",
      "Mental health is one of the biggest concerns, because now police are having to handle a lot of really difficult mental health problems on the street\n",
      "And I give credit—I give credit across the board going back two mayors, two police chiefs, because it has worked\n",
      "And so we need to do a better job of working, again, with the communities, faith communities, business communities, as well as the police to try to deal with this problem\n",
      "I think—I think—I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate\n",
      "Well, just listen to what you heard\n",
      "And clearly, as Donald just admitted, he knew he was going to stand on this debate stage, and Lester Holt was going to be asking us questions, so he tried to put the whole racist birther lie to bed\n",
      "There was absolutely no evidence for it, but he persisted, he persisted year after year, because some of his supporters, people that he was trying to bring into his fold, apparently believed it or wanted to believe it\n",
      "But, remember, Donald started his career back in 1973 being sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination because he would not rent apartments in one of his developments to African-Americans, and he made sure that the people who worked for him understood that was the policy\n",
      "He actually was sued twice by the Justice Department\n",
      "And I could tell how much it bothered him and annoyed him that this was being touted and used against him\n",
      "Well, I think cyber security, cyber warfare will be one of the biggest challenges facing the next president, because clearly we're facing at this point two different kinds of adversaries\n",
      "There are the independent hacking groups that do it mostly for commercial reasons to try to steal information that they can use to make money\n",
      "The most recent and troubling of these has been Russia\n",
      "There's no doubt now that Russia has used cyber attacks against all kinds of organizations in our country, and I am deeply concerned about this\n",
      "We need to make it very clear—whether it's Russia, China, Iran or anybody else—the United States has much greater capacity\n",
      "And we're going to have to make it clear that we don't want to use the kinds of tools that we have\n",
      "And the Russians need to understand that\n",
      "That is just unacceptable\n",
      "I think we need to do much more with our tech companies to prevent ISIS and their operatives from being able to use the Internet to radicalize, even direct people in our country and Europe and elsewhere\n",
      "And we're hoping that within the year we'll be able to push ISIS out of Iraq and then, you know, really squeeze them in Syria\n",
      "Because we've got to defeat ISIS, and we've got to do everything we can to disrupt their propaganda efforts online\n",

      "Bush made the agreement about when American troops would leave Iraq, not Barack Obama\n",
      "And we may find out more information because he is still alive, which may prove to be an intelligence benefit\n",
      "We're working with our friends in the Middle East, many of which, as you know, are Muslim majority nations\n",
      "Donald has consistently insulted Muslims abroad, Muslims at home, when we need to be cooperating with Muslim nations and with the American Muslim community\n",
      "They can provide information to us that we might not get anywhere else\n",
      "They need to have close working cooperation with law enforcement in these communities, not be alienated and pushed away as some of Donald's rhetoric, unfortunately, has led to\n",
      "After 9/11, when the 28 nations of NATO said that they would go to Afghanistan with us to fight terrorism, something that they still are doing by our side\n",
      "They had mastered the nuclear fuel cycle under the Bush administration\n",
      "So I spent a year-and-a-half putting together a coalition that included Russia and China to impose the toughest sanctions on Iran\n",
      "And so I know that this campaign has caused some questioning and worries on the part of many leaders across the globe\n",
      "If he's going to criticize a deal that has been very successful in giving us access to Iranian facilities that we never had before, then he should tell us what his alternative would be\n",

      "I want to lift up and use as examples business leaders like that, not somebody who stiffs contractors, who doesn't pay dishwashers and painters and plumbers and glass installers and architects and marble installers and so many else, but somebody who has the right attitude, that we're stronger together in business just like we are in government and America\n",
      "I want to see us have paid family leave, earned sick days, affordable childcare, and affordable college that includes tuition-free and debt-free college\n",
      "Because right now, it's way beyond what a lot of families can afford\n",
      "You can go to my website, but let me just tell you briefly\n",

      "And they are aided and abetted by the rules and incentives in our economy who actually encourage people at the top to take advantage of consumers, workers, small businesses, and taxpayers\n",
      "And it gets even harder when we don't aggressively enforce the rules, when we don't enforce trade rules that allow other countries with lower wages and standards to get an unfair leg up, when we don't enforce rules on Wall Street, which exerts enormous pressure on publicly traded companies to prioritize boosting share prices in the short term over building real value, investing in workers, plant, and equipment over the longer term\n",
      "It tilts the playing field further against small businesses that can't afford lawyers and lobbyists\n",

      "And here's what I really am just stunned by\n",

      "It is insulting when they engage in these games, like moving their headquarters over to a foreign country – on paper, not in reality – just to take advantage of lower tax rates\n",
      "No American should ever be taken advantage of, like thousands were, by Wells Fargo\n",
      "I fought to hold reckless managers accountable for toxic toys and household products that threaten our kids\n",
      "And it is the one making sure that the defrauded Wells Fargo customers get their money back\n",

      "His father bailed him out; apparently that's a pattern, you got to be bailed out when you do business with him\n",

      "I met a man who had a small family business, installed the glass in one of those casinos, submitted the bill, and Trump said, no\n",
      "Now, some of those small businesses, they couldn't afford that\n",
      "He basically just walked away from them, made them feel like they had failed even though they had done the work they'd been asked to provide\n",

      "I want us to make it easier to start a small business, to get rid of the red tape, to make credit available, to make it clear that most new jobs are going to come from small businesses in America, so we should have a big, dynamic small business economy\n",
      "But we are not going to let big business and big corporations call the shots anymore\n",
      "That is not working for us\n",

      "Well, he could not be more wrong, but thank goodness the rest of us paid to support our men and women in uniform who have done so much for us\n",
      "Today in Colorado, he claimed he brilliantly used the laws to avoid paying taxes\n",
      "Well, that just shows, number one, he is the poster boy – the poster boy – for the same rigged system that he would make even worse\n",
      "Just think about it\n",
      "What's he want us to do, pay him to lose money\n",
      "There's a lot more to this story, and we're just slowly getting it into the public eye\n",
      "He's always talked about how he can't release his taxes because he's under audit, but he admitted everything before 2009 is not under audit, so Donald, release everything up until 2009\n",
      "Well, a story just came out saying that Donald Trump used Chinese steel and aluminum for two out of the last three construction projects\n",
      "So instead of buying his steel and aluminum from American plants here in Ohio and Pennsylvania, instead of supporting hardworking families and American jobs, he once again stiffed us\n",
      "Now, for years, China has been undermining American businesses and workers by illegally dumping cheap aluminum and steel into our markets\n",
      "And I'll tell you, this is personal to me, because as a senator I went before the International Trade Commission on behalf of steel workers in New York who I represented\n",
      "I have put forward an agenda to crack down on trade abuses from countries like China, to stand up for American workers, and to rebuild American infrastructure with American materials like steel and aluminum\n",
      "And today in Toledo I pointed out, because Chrysler just announced an expansion of the plant there for the new Jeep Wrangler – about 700 more jobs, right\n",
      "I pointed out when the automobile industry was flat on its back and 850,000 workers in Ohio could have been absolutely out of a job – more than we can even imagine in terms of the long-lasting impact on the economy here – Donald Trump said he didn't care\n",
      "I stood in favor of saving the American automobile industry\n",
      "Last year, our auto industry had the best year they've had in a really long time\n",

      "Donald Trump stood on the stage of his convention and just once again painted this dark and dire picture of America\n",
      "' He gets confused between leadership and dictatorship\n",
      "But then, when he's cavalier – and I'm not talking about basketball – when he is cavalier about nuclear weapons, saying that, oh, he doesn't care if other countries get them; in fact, you know, if there were a nuclear war in East Asia, if Japan got nuclear weapons, if South Korea got nuclear weapons, hey, just go at it, folks\n",
      "And now it's even more important because it's not only states that we have to worry about, like North Korea; we've got to worry about terrorists getting their hands on nuclear weapons\n",
      "The last thing we want to do is just act like it doesn't matter, because it does\n",
      "And what I learned – if you use diplomacy and you're tough about it, you can actually get an agreement that put a lid on their nuclear program\n",
      "And we still have challenges with Iran, but I think we're in a stronger position given the fact that they are not racing for a nuclear weapon because we have intrusive inspections\n",
      "So I know diplomacy can work because I've done it, and I know that – we can defeat ISIS and the terrorists if we work with other nations, if we have a coalition that actually takes them out from the air, takes them out on the ground, and fights them online where they are doing so much damage by radicalizing and recruiting young people\n",
      "That he won't tell us about\n",

      "Now, after years of failure, she complains about how I've used the tax laws to my benefit\n",
      "Then why didn't she ever try to change those laws so I could not have used them the way I did\n",

      "Russia is new in terms of nuclear\n",
      "We're exhausted in terms of nuclear\n",
      "Because the fact is, almost everything she's done in foreign policy has been a mistake and it's been a disaster\n",

      "Why can't they do the attack, make it a sneak attack, and after the attack is made, inform the American public that we've knocked out the leaders, we've had a tremendous success\n",
      "Because everybody's talking about how Iraq, which is us with our leadership, goes in to fight Mosul\n",
      "Because NAFTA, signed by her husband, is perhaps the greatest disaster trade deal in the history of the world\n",
      "It stripped us of manufacturing jobs\n",

      "She used the power of her office to make a lot of money\n",
      "You've made a lot of it because of the fact that you've been in office\n",
      "I'm just curious\n",
      "I think it's such a great question, because energy is under siege by the Obama administration\n",
      "We are killing—absolutely killing our energy business in this country\n",
      "Hillary Clinton wants to put all the miners out of business\n",
      "Now we have natural gas and so many other things because of technology\n",
      "We have unbelievable—we have found over the last seven years, we have found tremendous wealth right under our feet\n",
      "They'll pay off our tremendous budget deficits, which are tremendous\n",
      "But we are putting our energy companies out of business\n",
      "The EPA is so restrictive that they are putting our energy companies out of business\n",
      "And all you have to do is go to a great place like West Virginia or places like Ohio, which is phenomenal, or places like Pennsylvania and you see what they're doing to the people, miners and others in the energy business\n",
      "Yes, I think that that's a very good question, because I've heard from lots of teachers and parents about some of their concerns about some of the things that are being said and done in this campaign\n",
      "And I think it is very important for us to make clear to our children that our country really is great because we're good\n",
      "That's why the slogan of my campaign is \\Stronger Together,\\ because I think if we work together, if we overcome the divisiveness that sometimes sets Americans against one another, and instead we make some big goals—and I've set forth some big goals, getting the economy to work for everyone, not just those at the top, making sure that we have the best education system from preschool through college and making it affordable, and so much else\n",
      "Obviously, I'm hoping to earn your vote, I'm hoping to be elected in November, and I can promise you, I will work with every American\n",
      "I want us to heal our country and bring it together because that's, I think, the best way for us to get the future that our children and our grandchildren deserve\n",
      "Because we've seen this throughout the campaign\n",
      "But it's not only women, and it's not only this video that raises questions about his fitness to be our president, because he has also targeted immigrants, African- Americans, Latinos, people with disabilities, POWs, Muslims, and so many others\n",
      "And the question for us, the question our country must answer is that this is not who we are\n",
      "That's why—to go back to your question—I want to send a message—we all should—to every boy and girl and, indeed, to the entire world that America already is great, but we are great because we are good, and we will respect one another, and we will work with one another, and we will celebrate our diversity\n",
      "These are very important values to me, because this is the America that I know and love\n",
      "Well, first, let me start by saying that so much of what he's just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses\n",
      "When I hear something like that, I am reminded of what my friend, Michelle Obama, advised us all: When they go low, you go high\n",
      "And, look, if this were just about one video, maybe what he's saying tonight would be understandable, but everyone can draw their own conclusions at this point about whether or not the man in the video or the man on the stage respects women\n",
      "He never apologized to the distinguished federal judge who was born in Indiana, but Donald said he couldn't be trusted to be a judge because his parents were, quote, \\Mexican\n",
      "because everything he just said is absolutely false, but I'm not surprised\n",
      "Last time at the first debate, we had millions of people fact checking, so I expect we'll have millions more fact checking, because, you know, it is—it's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country\n",
      "Well, Martha, first, let me say—and I've said before, but I'll repeat it, because I want everyone to hear it—that was a mistake, and I take responsibility for using a personal e-mail account\n",
      "Obviously, if I were to do it over again, I would not\n",
      "I'm not making any excuses\n",
      "But I think it's also important to point out where there are some misleading accusations from critics and others\n",
      "After a year-long investigation, there is no evidence that anyone hacked the server I was using and there is no evidence that anyone can point to at all—anyone who says otherwise has no basis—that any classified material ended up in the wrong hands\n",
      "I take classified materials very seriously and always have\n",
      "Obviously, as secretary of state, I had some of the most important secrets that we possess, such as going after bin Laden\n",
      "So I am very committed to taking classified information seriously\n",
      "Look, it's just not true\n",
      "I didn't in the first debate, and I'm going to try not to in this debate, because I'd like to get to the questions that the people have brought here tonight to talk to us about\n",
      "But let's at least focus\n",
      "And I'm going to fix it, because I agree with you\n",
      "But here's what I don't want people to forget when we're talking about reining in the costs, which has to be the highest priority of the next president, when the Affordable Care Act passed, it wasn't just that 20 million got insurance who didn't have it before\n",
      "But everybody else, the 170 million of us who get health insurance through our employees got big benefits\n",
      "Number one, insurance companies can't deny you coverage because of a pre-existing condition\n",
      "Number two, no lifetime limits, which is a big deal if you have serious health problems\n",
      "Number three, women can't be charged more than men for our health insurance, which is the way it used to be before the Affordable Care Act\n",
      "We've got to provide additional help to small businesses so that they can afford to provide health insurance\n",
      "But if we repeal it, as Donald has proposed, and start over again, all of those benefits I just mentioned are lost to everybody, not just people who get their health insurance on the exchange\n",
      "So I want us to get to 100 percent, but get costs down and keep quality up\n",
      "Obviously, Medicare, which is a single-payer system, which takes care of our elderly and does a great job doing it, by the way, and then all of the people who were employed, but people who were working but didn't have the money to afford insurance and didn't have anybody, an employer or anybody else, to help them\n",
      "So if we just rip it up and throw it away, what Donald's not telling you is we just turn it back to the insurance companies the way it used to be, and that means the insurance companies\n",
      "you may not be able to have insurance because you can't afford it\n",
      "And I've heard this question from a lot of Muslim-Americans across our country, because, unfortunately, there's been a lot of very divisive, dark things said about Muslims\n",
      "I want to say just a couple of things\n",
      "First, we've had Muslims in America since George Washington\n",
      "And we've had many successful Muslims\n",
      "We just lost a particular well-known one with Muhammad Ali\n",
      "It's also very short-sighted and even dangerous to be engaging in the kind of demagogic rhetoric that Donald has about Muslims\n",
      "We need American Muslims to be part of our eyes and ears on our front lines\n",
      "I've worked with a lot of different Muslim groups around America\n",
      "It's also important I intend to defeat ISIS, to do so in a coalition with majority Muslim nations\n",
      "So I want a country where citizens like you and your family are just as welcome as anyone else\n",
      "Well, first of all, I will not let anyone into our country that I think poses a risk to us\n",
      "But there are a lot of refugees, women and children—think of that picture we all saw of that 4-year-old boy with the blood on his forehead because he'd been bombed by the Russian and Syrian air forces\n",
      "There are children suffering in this catastrophic war, largely, I believe, because of Russian aggression\n",
      "But it is important for us as a policy, you know, not to say, as Donald has said, we're going to ban people based on a religion\n",
      "We are a country founded on religious freedom and liberty\n",
      "How do we do what he has advocated without causing great distress within our own county\n",
      "Are we going to have religious tests when people fly into our country\n",
      "So I thought that what he said was extremely unwise and even dangerous\n",
      "And indeed, you can look at the propaganda on a lot of the terrorists sites, and what Donald Trump says about Muslims is used to recruit fighters, because they want to create a war between us\n",
      "And, yes, President Lincoln was trying to convince some people, he used some arguments, convincing other people, he used other arguments\n",
      "But, you know, let's talk about what's really going on here, Martha, because our intelligence community just came out and said in the last few days that the Kremlin, meaning Putin and the Russian government, are directing the attacks, the hacking on American accounts to influence our election\n",
      "And WikiLeaks is part of that, as are other sites where the Russians hack information, we don't even know if it's accurate information, and then they put it out\n",
      "Now, maybe because he has praised Putin, maybe because he says he agrees with a lot of what Putin wants to do, maybe because he wants to do business in Moscow, I don't know the reasons\n",
      "with the Russians and other foreign powers\n",
      "Well, everything you've heard just now from Donald is not true\n",
      "And it is sort of amusing to hear somebody who hasn't paid federal income taxes in maybe 20 years talking about what he's going to do\n",
      "His plan will give the wealthy and corporations the biggest tax cuts they've ever had, more than the Bush tax cuts by at least a factor of two\n",
      "I have said nobody who makes less than $250,000 a year—and that's the vast majority of Americans as you know—will have their taxes raised, because I think we've got to go where the money is\n",
      "We have to make up for lost times, because I want to invest in you\n",
      "Because I was a senator with a Republican president\n",
      "Eight million kids every year have health insurance, because when I was first lady I worked with Democrats and Republicans to create the Children's Health Insurance Program\n",
      "Hundreds of thousands of kids now have a chance to be adopted because I worked to change our adoption and foster care system\n",
      "After 9/11, I went to work with Republican mayor, governor and president to rebuild New York and to get health care for our first responders who were suffering because they had run toward danger and gotten sickened by it\n",
      "Hundreds of thousands of National Guard and Reserve members have health care because of work that I did, and children have safer medicines because I was able to pass a law that required the dosing to be more carefully done\n",

      "Are we going to work together to build a stronger fairer better America, or are we going to fear the future and fear each other and hunker down and be paralyzed by all of our prejudices, our discrimination that stops us from coming together\n",
      "The truth is we don't have to imagine what that would be like, because everything that Donald Trump has said and done, both in his career and in his campaign, is a preview of what could happen\n",
      "If Donald Trump were to win this election, we would have a commander and chief who is completely out of his depth and whose ideas are incredibly dangerous\n",
      "Someone who wants more countries to have nuclear weapons, and who could easily insult a foreign leader and start a real war instead of just a twitter war\n",
      "In a country that values, religious liberty and freedom\n",
      "Someone who would ban every Muslim in the world from ever coming to our country\n",
      "He has no idea, none, about the strength of the black church, the vibrancy of black owned businesses, the excellence of historically black colleges and universities, the rise of a new generation of black activists for social justice and the success of black leaders in every field\n",
      "Remember how he denied housing to Mae Brown Wiggins\n",
      "In fact, Donald, his father Fred and their entire company were sued by the Justice Department for discriminating against African Americans and Latinos in the 1970s\n",
      "They settled the case, but the Justice Department was forced to go after them again because they continued to discriminate against people of color\n",
      "If he were to win, he would be in charge of the federal housing department\n",
      "If he doesn't respect all Americans, how can we trust him to serve all Americans\n",
      "So they were finally released from prison and justice was done, but not only did Donald Trump refuse to apologize for calling for their execution, he actually said they should still be in prison\n",
      "Do we want him controlling the Justice Department\n",
      "Just a few days ago, and I want you to hear this because this has never happened to a major -- to a nominee of a major party\n",
      "Just a few days ago, Donald Trump was endorsed by the official newspaper of the Ku Klux Klan\n",
      "You've got to ask yourself: Do any of us -- any of us who believe in our Constitution, who believe in the rule of law, who believe that we are stronger together, who believe that we want to keep moving positively toward the vision of freedom and equality set forth by our founders -- do any of us have a place in Trump's America\n",
      "It's not just about communities of color\n",
      "It's about any of us who don't ever want us to go back to a time when you could officially discriminate; where people could be intimidated\n",
      "Just imagine what that would mean to young women's confidence and self-worth\n",
      "I've said many times in this campaign that Donald Trump has showed us who he is\n",
      "And across America, people are doing just that -- rejecting Trump's dark and divisive vision for one that is much more hopeful, inclusive and unifying\n",
      "In fact, we are commanded, those of us who are Christians, to love our neighbor as ourselves, aren't we\n",
      "When I used to teach Sunday School, I often taught on that, not because it was well known, but because I think it's so hard and challenging\n",
      "Because here's what we're going to do if we win this election\n",
      "We are not going to accept the status quo\n",
      "Who would do that to a house of worship\n",
      "I'm just telling you\n",

      "We will reform our criminal justice system from end to end\n",
      "What I think we need to do, is to work together to restore trust between our police and our communities\n",
      "And it's not all, we are going to take common sense steps to reduce gun violence and save lives, because right now, we've got too many people who should not have excess to weapons: the mentally ill, felons, domestic abusers, terrorists\n",
      "You know, we can't just bow down and say theres nothing we can do, commensurate with the second amendment\n",
      "There's some good ideas in the Congress to focus on communities, white, black, Latino, Native American, wherever they might be that have been left out\n",
      "We need to get the engine of economic growth going, because we believe that we should have an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top\n",
      "We believe that we should raise the national minimum wage, because anyone who works full time in poverty should not be mired and left behind\n",
      "I don't know about you, but this is not just a women's issue\n",
      "I'm always accused by Donald and his supporters, that whenever I talk like that, I'm playing the woman's card\n",
      "But I actually think I'm playing the family economics card, because if you have a mother, a wife, a sister or a daughter, she deserves to be paid fairly for what she does in the work force\n",
      "I just think that's a bad, bad idea\n",
      "If you want to, I'm going to make it affordable for you, but if you also want some other way of making a good living, let's bring technical education back into high schools and connect them up with community colleges and business apprenticeships\n",
      "I just don't believe we're at our best when we stoke fear about each other\n",
      "But it does mean we have to be willing to listen and to come together to solve problems that affect us individually and as a society\n",
      "Because the other's strategy is to scare people and intimidate people from going to the polls\n",
      "Now, Donald Trump's campaign knows that if women turn out, if people of color turn out, if young people turn out, if people who share our vision of a positive unified country, turnout, there's no way he can win, because that is more than half the people in America\n",
      "He's coming back to North Carolina tomorrow, because he know how hard it is to get anything done in Washington\n",
      "He's going to have to bend down for me to be able to reach it, because you know he's a tall man\n",
      "It is so great to be back here with all of you, and there are a few people in the audience that I just want to acknowledge because I'm delighted they're there -- U\n",
      "Because everything Pharrell and Bernie just said is not only about the presidential election and what's at stake, it is about who's going to represent you as your governor, as your senator, as members of Congress and the legislature, and you have some excellent candidates\n",
      "And I -- I think because of that campaign, we were able to raise a lot of the issues that you heard Bernie talking about to the level that they are part of this presidential cam-paign, and they will be part of our agenda after January 20th, Bernie\n",
      "Because as Bernie said earlier this year, when people who care about progressive causes stand together, we win, and then we can get to work on making those causes into realities for the lives of our people\n",
      "He wants to -- and I'm going to do everything I can help him -- to deliver -- giving kids who are at risk access to educational and arts programs that they deserve to have just as much as any other child\n",
      "We can all use you in these last days\n",
      "Well, I'm glad to hear that because it's time you had a governor who puts families first, not radical ideology\n",
      "And I love seeing our educators stand up and applaud because you need a governor who actually cares about the education of the children of North Carolina\n",
      "I went to Alabama undercover to gather information about segregated academies to deprive them of tax-exempt status, which they did not deserve\n",
      "I went door-to-door in New Bedford, Massachusetts, gathering information to make the case that every child in America, including children with disabilities, should have the right to a public school education\n",
      "And as we heard this morning from a -- just a wonderful, distinguished older woman by the name of Mae Wiggins who came all the way down to tell her story\n",
      "So she had the gumption to go and make a complaint, which led to the Justice Depart-ment suing them for discrimination\n",
      "They settled the suit, but then they had to come back a year later and sue them again because they were still discriminating\n",
      "So when you hear, as Bernie so powerfully said at the end of his remarks, that we are standing against the possibility of returning and normalizing discrimination, take it seriously, my friends, because it truly is -- it truly is at stake in this election\n",
      "I met a woman here in North Carolina who told her story and we actually recorded it because all of us were so moved by what she had to say when her baby was born\n",
      "And she was telling her doctor she didn't know what to do, and the doctor just serendipitously said, \\You know, there's this new program, it's called the Children's Health Insurance Program\n",
      "She told me how proud she was because she had just graduated from college, George Washington University\n",
      "Tim Kaine and I put a whole book out called \\Stronger Together\\ telling you exactly what we're going to try to do if we're fortunate enough to be president and vice president because I actually think it's important for you to know what we're going to do together\n",
      "You know, when I was first lady, I had a great commitment to kids in foster care and I wanted to improve our foster care and adoption laws, and I was looking for some Re-publican to work with me, and I found one because I did my research and found out that one of the most partisan Republicans, Congressman Tom DeLay from Texas, had a heart for children in foster care\n",
      "\\ I said, \\Well, come to the White House\n",
      "Now, I'm telling you this because I really believe that's the only way we're going to get things done\n",
      "So, let me just mention a few of the ideas that we've been putting forward to help you and your families get ahead and stay ahead because I truly believe you need a candidate you can vote for, not just someone to vote against\n",
      "But as you're making this choice, we need to be clear about what the choice is, because come January 20th, America will have a new president\n",
      "I want you just to imagine, imagine the different kinds of futures that are available depending upon who's elected on January 20th, because by imagining it, I want you to think about every issue you care about, everything that is dear to you, everything that you heard from Pharrell and from Bernie\n",
      "And I think that's an im-portant signal because this is a big decision\n",
      "And he wants to ban every Muslim in the world from coming to the United States\n",
      "Our country is founded on religious freedom\n",
      "He has no idea -- no idea about the strength of the black church, the vibrancy of black-owned businesses, the excellence of historically black colleges and universities\n",
      "He seems not to recognize the rise of a new generation of black activists for social justice and the success of black leaders in every field\n",
      "But not only did Trump refuse to apologize for what he had said about them and even calling for their executions, he actually said, \\They should still be in prison\n",
      "So think about it, if he wants to keep exonerated people in jail, how can we trust him to fight for the rule of justice and fairness and criminal justice reform in America\n",
      "Do we want him controlling the Justice Department\n",
      "Well, I've said many times, he has shown us who he is, now it is up to us to decide who we are\n",
      "And right now, people across our country are coming together to do just that\n",
      "They are rejecting the dark and divisive vision for one that is more hopeful and inclusive\n",
      "We're going to take on systemic racism with a full commitment and real follow-through because we refuse to accept as normal some of what we're seeing across America\n",
      "Too many young African-Americans are dying in police incidents or because of gun violence\n",
      "We have got to face this, and we're going to get to work to do just that\n",
      "And we will reform our criminal justice system from end-to-end\n",
      "When I -- when I launched this campaign back in April of 2015, the very first speech I gave was on the topic of criminal justice reform\n",
      "I said then and I have repeated it throughout this campaign, we must end the era of mass incarceration\n",
      "And we have to restore trust between police and communities\n",
      "This is important, of course, to families and communities, but it is important to all of us\n",
      "This is about who we are as a country, about whether we really are a nation that believes in freedom and justice for all\n",
      "And I have to say - I have to say that is only part of what must be done because the leading cause of death for young African-American men, more than the next nine causes\n",
      "I just cannot tolerate this any longer\n",
      "We have to take steps to reduce gun violence, and I know we can do that because the vast majority of Americans agree something must be done and a very big majority of gun owners agree as well\n",
      "I believe that the economy must work for everyone, not just those at the top\n",
      "Just as Bernie said, we're going to make the wealthy pay their fair share, and make sure Wall Street never threatens Main Street again\n",
      "And in my plan is a $25 billion fund specifically aimed at supporting historically black colleges and universities - schools like Shaw and Saint Augustine - because you know they produce some of the finest leaders in our country, and I want to make sure they keep doing that vital work\n",
      "I mean, Bernie and I could really keep you here until breakfast because we get excited about what we can do\n",
      "This is going to be one of the most consequential elections in our country's history, you know that, because we are at a crossroads\n",
      "It's not just who my opponent is\n",
      "It's not just about him, although there are some special features that certainly raise deep concerns\n",
      "I believe -- I believe America's best days are still ahead of us if we do what we're sup-posed to do\n",
      "Every social movement, every economic advance has only come about because people were willing to work and sacrifice and keep pushing forward in the face of adversity\n",
      "It wasn't easy because there are powerful interests still trying to push us back and push us down\n",
      "And right now, you know, because in this state a lot of effort was put into trying to suppress the vote, right\n",
      "It is now our turn -- our turn to stand up to people like your governor and your legislature who wanted to shut you down and push you back because we are fundamentally a good nation and we need to make sure we deliver on that promise\n",
      "So I got to tell you, I've told the president I'm ready to take the baton, but he's going to have to bend over because he's a lot taller than I am\n",
      "But I'm not just taking it, all of us are taking it\n",
      "We are ready to grab that baton, to defend and build upon the progress of his presidency, and that is why everyone must vote\n",
      "com to confirm your voting location because the best way to repudiate the bigotry and the bluster and the bullying and the hateful rhetoric and discrimination is to show up with the biggest turnout in American history\n",
      "And I thank, on behalf of all of us I want to thank Alicia Machado for that introduction and for sharing her story with us\n",
      "I also want to thank Representative Amanda Hickman from the Florida State House, Michael Cox, chairman of the Greater Pasco Chamber of Commerce, Michael Ledbetter, who is the Pasco County Democratic executive committee chair and his wife Beverly\n",
      "And I especially want to thank all of you for not just joining us but helping us to get out the vote in this last week\n",

      "Because honestly I believe this may be the most important election of our lifetimes\n",
      "I was in the Situation Room when we brought Osama Bin Laden to justice\n",
      "And maybe for you if you think about all of the issues that separate Donald Trump from me, it could be his dangerous statements about nuclear weapons\n",
      "When a journalist told Donald Trump that people were worried about how casually he talks about using nuclear weapons, he said, 'Well then why are we making them\n",
      "' And therefore they cannot support Donald Trump, because he does not have the temperament to be our commander-in-chief and handle those responsibilities\n",
      "I think what we want is to bring them out of the shadows so that they can't be exploited by employers like Donald Trump, who refused to hire Americans and hired undocumented workers so he could pay them less\n",
      "Now maybe for some of you, what Donald Trump said about prisoners of war will be enough reason to vote against him, somebody who questioned the patriotism and the service of John McCain because he was a prison of war\n",
      "Or maybe for some of you, it's what he said about a judge born in Indiana, who just happened to be assigned the case brought by people who were defrauded by the phony Trump University\n",
      "And so Trump said, 'Well, we can't trust him because his parents were born in Mexico\n",
      "' Now Paul Ryan, the Republican Speaker of the House, called — well, but wait a minute, — he called what Trump said about that distinguished federal judge, 'The definition of a racist comment\n",

      "I know I'm reaching out to Republicans and Independents as well as Democrats because I want to be the president for all Americans\n",
      "But today, I want to just spend a few minutes focusing in particular about what he has said and what he has done to woman and girls because – Any of you see the debates\n",
      "I stood next to Donald for four and a half hours during those three debates, proving conclusively I have the stamina to be President of the United States\n",
      "And during those debates, Donald always used to say, 'What have you been doing for 30 years\n",
      "' And I always found that kind of odd, because he could Google it and find out\n",
      "I would, frankly, rather be here talking about nearly anything else, like how we're going to create good jobs and get the economy working for everybody, not just those at the top\n",
      "How we're going to make college affordable for every single family, because I have a plan that if your family makes less than $125,000, you will not pay tuition to go to a state college or university\n",
      "But I can't just talk about all of the good things we want to do, because people are making up their minds\n",

      "And thankfully, Alicia refuses to let such a small person get her down\n",
      "Because, let's be honest here, the world has a way of telling our girls exactly the opposite – they don't look right, they're not thin enough, they don't act right, no one will like them unless they change their clothes or straighten their hair or stop being bossy, or whatever the criticism might be\n",
      "And I remember, when Chelsea was a teenager, I would wait on the second floor of the White House in the long hall that's there for her to come home from school\n",
      "And that time together was really valuable to me as a parent, because we parents, and I know there are a lot of parents here today, we work hard to give our kids a sense of confidence to send them out into the world believing in their own value, and it really is important that we don't let anybody take that away from them\n",
      "And we've got to work hard to make sure our boys, just like our girls, have that same sense of positive energy: not negative, not tearing people down – lifting people up and respecting women\n",
      "In fact, all of us should respect each other in our country\n",

      "Let us on Tuesday show him who we are\n",
      "We're going to fight for paid family leave, we're going to fight to make sure everybody gets raising wages in America and that's important because so many people still struggling, still working hard, raising a family, having a hard time getting all of their bills paid\n",
      "I'm excited because I know we can do this and I will stand up and I will fight for you, I will work for you, I will give my heart to this mission of making our country all it should be\n",
